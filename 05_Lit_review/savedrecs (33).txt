J	Dong, ZB; Wang, T; Wang, XM				Dong, ZB; Wang, T; Wang, XM			Geomorphology of the megadunes in the Badain Jaran desert	GEOMORPHOLOGY												The Badain Jaran Desert features the highest megadunes on Earth, and a unique megadune-lake alternation landscape. Based on field survey and interpretation of aerial photographs, this paper examines the general characteristics of the Badain Jaran megadunes, their morphometry and formation, as well as the formation of megadune-lake alternation landscape. It is suggested that the megadunes in the Badain Jaran Desert were developed in a low wind energy environment. The compound transverse megadunes, the dominant megadune type, have a similar wind regime to barchanoid dunes, and the compound star megadunes, which occur near the mountains, have a similar wind regime to star dunes. Similar to the barchanoid dunes, the height, base area and spacing of the compound transverse megadunes show reasonably good inter-correlation. The base area of the megadunes and the area of the leeward interdune lake basins are also inter-correlated. The alignment and spacing of the Badain Jaran megadunes implies that wind is the most important factor in their development; the morphology underneath the megadunes does not determine the general pattern of the megadunes as previously suggested. Repetitions of dune fixation and reactivation in the development process played an important role in increasing the megadunes' height, hence their size. The interdune lakes in the megadune area were mainly formed by talus springs and are only partly fed by atmospheric precipitation. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Wild birds and domestic poultry often occupy sympatric habitats, which facilitate the mutual transmission of intestinal microbes. However, the distinct intestinal microbial communities between sympatric wild birds and poultry remain unknown. At present, the risk of interspecies transmission of pathogenic bacteria between wild and domestic host birds is also a research hotspot. Methods This study compared the intestinal bacterial communities of the overwintering Hooded Crane (Grus monacha) and the Domestic Goose (Anser anser domesticus) at Shengjin Lake, China, using Illumina high-throughput sequencing technology (Mi-Seq platform). Results Our results revealed that Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Chloroflexi were the dominant bacterial phyla in both hosts. The gut bacterial community composition differed significantly between sympatric Hooded Cranes and Domestic Geese. However, the hosts exhibited little variation in gut bacterial alpha-diversity. The relative abundance of Firmicutes was significantly higher in the guts of the Hooded Cranes, while the relative abundances of Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidete and Chloroflexi were significantly higher in guts of Domestic Geese. Moreover, a total of 132 potential pathogenic operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were detected in guts of Hooded Cranes and Domestic Geese, and 13 pathogenic OTUs (9.8%) were found in both host guts. Pathogenic bacterial community composition and diversity differed significantly between hosts. Conclusions The results showed that the gut bacterial community composition differs significantly between sympatric Hooded Cranes and Domestic Geese. In addition, potential pathogens were detected in the guts of both Hooded Cranes and Domestic Geese, with 13 pathogenic OTUs overlapping between the two hosts, suggesting that more attention should be paid to wild birds and poultry that might increase the risk of disease transmission in conspecifics and other mixed species.					; Zhou, Lizhi/AAF-4535-2021	zhouZhou, li zhiLizhi/0000-0002-5702-4658; Cheng, Lei/0009-0004-2755-0413; 													2053-7166					APR 30	2020	11	1							13	10.1186/s40657-020-00195-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40657-020-00195-9													WOS:000531294600002

Evaluating the growth potential of sea lampreys (Petromyzon marinus) feeding on siscowet lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) in Lake Superior	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Differences in the preferred thermal habitat of Lake Superior lake trout morphotypes create alternative growth scenarios for parasitic sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) attached to lake trout hosts. Siscowet lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) inhabit deep, consistently cold water (4-6 degrees C) and are more abundant than lean lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) which occupy temperatures between 8 and 12 degrees C during summer thermal stratification. Using bioenergetics models we contrasted the growth potential of sea lampreys attached to siscowet and lean lake trout to determine how host temperature influences the growth and ultimate size of adult sea lamprey. Sea lampreys simulated under the thermal regime of siscowets are capable of reaching sizes within the range of adult sea lamprey sizes observed in Lake Superior tributaries. High lamprey wounding rates on siscowets suggest siscowets are important lamprey hosts. In addition, siscowets have higher survival rates from lamprey attacks than those observed for lean lake trout which raises the prospect that siscowets serve as a buffer to predation on more commercially desirable hosts such as lean lake trout, and could serve to subsidize lamprey growth.

J	Arnous, MB; Courcol, N; Carrias, JF				Arnous, Mohamad-Bashir; Courcol, Nicolas; Carrias, Jean-Francois			The significance of transparent exopolymeric particles in the vertical distribution of bacteria and heterotrophic nanoflagellates in Lake Pavin	AQUATIC SCIENCES												The abundance, size distribution, and bacterial colonization of Transparent Exopolymeric Particles (TEP) were examined in two consecutive years during the spring diatom development throughout the water column of the deep meromictic Lake Pavin, France. TEP concentrations ranged from 1.9 to 13.4 x 10(5) particles l(-1) and their distribution and size spectra indicated that these particles are the main factor in governing the transport of diatoms to the deep hypolimnion of the lake. The majority of TEP was colonized by bacteria that constituted 0.4-8.9% of total DAPI-stained bacteria. The intensity of bacterial colonization was strongly related to temperature and decreased with particle size. A more important colonization of small particles in the hypolimnion during thermal stratification suggested that bacterial colonisation also increased with the age of the particle. The abundance of heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNF) was more significantly related to the density of particles than to the density of total bacteria and the intensity of bacterial colonization of TEP. Our results therefore suggest that TEP are a more important factor for HNF development than attached and free bacteria. We conclude that TEP are involved not only in sedimentation processes but also in the dynamics of bacteria and protozoa in freshwater pelagic environments.					; Carrias, Jean-François/AAT-2738-2021	Carrias, Jean-Francois/0000-0002-6201-1544; 													1015-1621	1420-9055				MAR	2010	72	2					245	253		10.1007/s00027-010-0127-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-010-0127-x													WOS:000274707200009
J	Culpepper, J; Huang, L; Woolway, RI; Sharma, S				Culpepper, Joshua; Huang, Lei; Woolway, R. Iestyn; Sharma, Sapna			Widespread loss of safe lake ice access in response to a warming climate	PLOS ONE												Millions of people rely on lake ice for safe winter recreation. Warming air temperatures impact the phenology (timing of formation and breakup) and quality (ratio of black to white ice) of lake ice cover, both critical components of ice safety. Later formation and earlier breakup of lake ice lead to overall shorter periods of use. However, greater proportions of white ice may further inhibit safe ice use owing to its lower weight-bearing capacity. As ice cover duration decreases and ice quality changes in a warming world, the period of safe ice use will similarly diminish. We use a large ensemble modeling approach to predict ice safety throughout the winter period in the Northern Hemisphere. We used the Community Earth System Model Version 2 Large Ensemble (CESM2-LE) to calculate the period when ice first appears until it is of sufficient thickness for safe use, which depends on the ratio of black to white ice. We conducted this analysis for 2,379 to 2,829 similar to 1 degrees by 1 degrees grid cells throughout the Northern Hemisphere. We focus on the period between ice formation (>= 2 cm) to a safe thickness for general human use (i.e., >= 10, >= 15, or >= 20 cm, depending on the ratio of black to white ice). We find that the transition period from unsafe to safe ice cover is growing longer, while the total duration of safe ice cover is getting shorter. The transition period of unsafe ice increases by 5.0 +/- 3.7 days in a 4 degrees C warmer world, assuming 100% black ice. Diminished ice quality further limits safe ice conditions. The unsafe transition period increases by an average of 19.8 +/- 8.9 days and 8.8 +/- 6.6 days for the ice formation and breakup periods, respectively in a 4 degrees C warmer world assuming 100% white ice conditions. We show that although many lakes are forecasted to freeze, they will be unsafe to use for an average of 5 to 29 fewer days in a 4 degrees C warmer world for 100% black and 100% white ice ratios, respectively. This wide range indicates that ice quality has a strong influence on ice safety. This work highlights the need to understand both lake ice phenology and quality to better assess safe lake ice use during the formation and melt periods.

Behavioral repertoire of a population of wild Chilean Flamingos Phoenicopterus chilensis in southern Brazil	JOURNAL OF NATURAL HISTORY												The Lagoa do Peixe National Park in southern Brazil is an important contranuptial site for many bird species, including Chilean Flamingos that come from Andean highlands and the South Atlantic coast, mainly during the southern hemisphere winter, and is the only site where Chilean flamingos can be seen all year long. Despite that, the information about ecology and behaviour of the flamingos in the region is still scarce and incomplete. With that in mind, we aim to construct a behavioural repertoire of this population of wild Chilean Flamingos, which can be used in conservation and management actions, future research and for educational purposes. Between May and November 2019, we made focal observation of the individuals of the park, totalising 99.8 h. We observed 41 different behaviours divided in 5 major categories: Feeding, Locomotion, Maintenance, Agonistic Social and Non-Agonistic Social. Our records confirmed behavioural observations made by other studies in flamingo behaviour, but we also registered new behaviours for the first time in the area, like the occurrence of synchronised behaviours of flamingo flocks. We also recorded a variety of feeding and maintenance behaviours that indicate the influence of environmental and populational variables on the behaviours of the species. Our data demonstrate the differences among captive and wild population behaviours, reinforce the relevance of behavioural studies in contranuptial areas and the importance of these areas to the species.					; Carlos, Caio/G-4345-2010	Cardoso Delfino, Henrique/0000-0001-5023-273X; Carlos, Caio J./0000-0001-9071-1444; 													0022-2933	1464-5262				AUG 18	2021	55	31-32					1957	1981		10.1080/00222933.2021.1978574	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00222933.2021.1978574													WOS:000706094300001

In this paper, pollen percentages of the sub-continental scale modern pollen-climate dataset from China and Mongolia (with 68% soil-surface samples) are homogenized at various spatial scales. A tailored calibration-set is then applied to lake sediment-surface pollen assemblages from north-central China to evaluate their predictive power. Results indicate that spatial homogenization of modern pollen percentages can increase the proportion of inertia explained by climatic variables in CCA and improve the model performance of leave-one-out cross-validation using WA-PLS. Soil-surface pollen assemblages can thus be employed into a calibration-set for reliable climate estimation and they perform better when the calibration-set has been locally homogenized. Small-scale (e.g., radii 2, 5, or 10 km) homogenization reduces the local noise in soil-surface pollen assemblages and improves the cross-validated performance, while broader scale homogenization (more than 20 km radius) blurs the pollen-climate relationship. Lake sediment-surface pollen assemblages from close to the shore could contain pollen grains transported by rivers or from the shore vegetation and thus fail to represent regional climate well like the assemblages from the central part and deep-water area of lake.

Objectives In the fluvial Lake Saint-Pierre (St. Lawrence River, Canada), we studied how agricultural practices and water-flow regulation have impacted the area and connectivity of spawning habitats of northern pike (Esox lucius). Methods Northern pike spawning and nursery habitats were modelled over a 49-year period (1965-2013) to estimate effective spawning area under four contrasting hydrological conditions. Results Simulations coupled with land cover analyses revealed that natural flow conditions historically favourable for fish reproduction (high and stable water flows) have been lost due to human activities. The highest potential for reproduction and habitat connectivity have been lost due to (1) intensive agriculture and ploughing of natural vegetation in the upper floodplain that overlaps suitable spawning areas for northern pike, and (2) flow regulation that has lowered and shortened spring floods and dried spawning grounds more frequently. Conclusions To restore the St. Lawrence River functions, we propose to reconvert the portion of the floodplains that is vital to fish, but is currently used by intensive agriculture, into natural wetlands or perennial crops and to restore a more natural flow regime by extending the duration of floods between spawning and nursery periods. The highest priority for habitat restoration should target the most effective and recurrent spawning habitats, ditch and stream networks, and connected managed wetlands.

Maker Buoy Variants for Water Level Monitoring and Tracking Drifting Objects in Remote Areas of Greenland	SENSORS												Meltwater runoff from the Greenland Ice Sheet changes water levels in glacial lakes and can lead to glacial lake outburst flooding (GLOF) events that threaten lives and property. Icebergs produced at Greenland's marine terminating glaciers drift into Baffin Bay and the North Atlantic, where they can threaten shipping and offshore installations. Thus, monitoring glacial lake water levels and the drift of icebergs can enhance safety and aid in the scientific studies of glacial hydrology and iceberg-ocean interactions. The Maker Buoy was originally designed as a low-cost and open source sensor to monitor surface ocean currents. The open source framework, low-cost components, rugged construction and affordable satellite data transmission capabilities make it easy to customize for environmental monitoring in remote areas and under harsh conditions. Here, we present two such Maker Buoy variants that were developed to monitor water level in an ice-infested glacial lake in southern Greenland and to track drifting icebergs and moorings in the Vaigat Strait (Northwest Greenland). We describe the construction of each design variant, methods to access data in the field without an internet connection, and deployments in Greenland in summer 2019. The successful deployments of each Maker Buoy variant suggest that they may also be useful in operational iceberg management strategies and in GLOF monitoring programs.					; Carlson, Daniel/AAQ-1739-2020	Carlson, Daniel/0000-0002-3013-6633; Petersen, Dorthe/0000-0003-2100-5890; 														1424-8220				MAR	2020	20	5							1254	10.3390/s20051254	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s20051254								32106576					WOS:000525271500016
J	BROOKS, CM; EFFLER, SW				BROOKS, CM; EFFLER, SW			THE DISTRIBUTION OF NITROGEN SPECIES IN POLLUTED ONONDAGA-LAKE, NY, USA	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												The temporal and vertical distributions of four N species, NO3-, NO2-, total ammonia (T-NH3), and free ammonia (NH3), are documented for Onondaga Lake, an urban, polluted, hypereutrophic, dimictic, lake that receives a very high load of T-NH3. Nitrate and NO2- were lost rapidly from the hypolimnion, and T-NH3 accumulated to high concentrations (maximum > 10 mgN L-1), after the onset of anoxia, consistent with the lake's high level of productivity. The concentrations of T-NH3, NH3 and NO3- that were maintained in the epilimnion (average concentrations at a depth of 1 m of 2.81, 0.16 and 0.91 mgN L-1, respectively), and concentrations of NO2- that developed in the epilimnion (maximum of 0.48 mgN L-1), were high in comparison to levels reported in the literature. These elevated concentrations are largely a result of the extremely high loads of T-NH3, and its precursors, received by the lake. Water quality problems in the lake related to the prevailing high concentrations of N species include potential toxicity effects and severe lake-wide oxygen depletion during fall turnover.																			0049-6979					AUG	1990	52	3-4					247	262		10.1007/BF00229437	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00229437													WOS:A1990ET00600005

To meet some of this need, a monitoring process for localizing armored suckermouth catfish (Pterygoplichthys) burrows using sound navigation and ranging (SONAR) data and a deep neural network for semantic segmentation was devised and tested on real-world data. Raw SONAR data was captured using a SONAR mounted on a small remotely operated vehicle (ROV) at De Le & oacute;n Springs State Park in Volusia County, Florida and then converted to two-dimensional image for semantic segmentation in DeepLabv3, a deep neural network. The neural network was used to identify armored suckermouth catfish burrows along the bottom of bodies of water at the park. The neural network-labeled images were then converted back to point clouds and clustered using a clustering algorithm that outlined the catfish burrows in a convex hull. The point clouds defining the burrows and the convex hulls were then geolocated using the known location of the ROV provided by an ultra-short baseline (USBL) buoy.																			0028-1425	1559-3584				SEP 1	2024	136	3					205	217																WOS:001422189600015

Thus, a pilot study of water resources in the Saskatchewan River Sub-basin was undertaken in order to provide first-cut estimates of impacts in this region, and to identify future research needs. Thirty scenarios were constructed, using two hypothetical growth rates for irrigation, five scenarios based on outputs from General Circulation Models (GCMs), and ten hypothetical warming scenarios. During the course of this study, a number of methodological questions were raised, including the representativeness of data points, interpolation of observed and scenario data, and the quantification of uncertainty. Results indicated decreases in summer soil moisture and increases in irrigation demand, but no consensus on changes in runoff or annual net basin supply, primarily due to differences in the GCM-based scenario output at the Rocky Mountains, the major source region for runoff. There were a number of recommendations for follow-up research and monitoring.																			0165-0009					OCT	1991	19	3					291	317		10.1007/BF00140168	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00140168													WOS:A1991GN42800004
J	Butcher, RW				Butcher, R. W.			Studies on the ecology of rivers - I. On the distribution of macrophytic vegetation in the rivers of Britain	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												The macrophytic vegetation of 9 English rivers is described, viz.: New Forest streams, Leven (Lanes.), Mole (Surrey), Tees (Durham-Yorks.), Wharfe (Yorks.), Tern (Shrops.), Dove (Derby), Itchen (Hamps.), Lark (Suff.). The chief habitat factors are rapidity and variability of current resulting in differences in silting of the bed, and calcareous content of the water. Four types of habitat are distinguished: Torrential, characterised by mossy vegetation of Eur-hynchium and Fontinalis (in calc.-water) ; nonsilted, with Ranunculus fluitans and Myriophyllum spicatum; partly silted, with Potamogeton polygonijolius (in non-calc. water), P. perjoliatus, and Sparganium simplex; silted, with Juncus supinus (in non. calc), Callitriche stagnalis, Elodea, arid P. crispus; and littoral region, with Sparganium erectum. The plant communities are impermanent, and tend to shift down-stream. In some cases the vegetation dies down in winter and in others not. It is affected by sewage pollution and excessive deposition of silt, and itself affects the rate of current-flow and silt-deposition.																			0022-0477	1365-2745				FEB	1933	21	1					58	91		10.2307/2255874	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2255874													WOS:000202873400005

Paleoclimatic numerical models suggest the mechanisms. In subtropical latitudes such as North Africa the enhanced summer insolation culminating about 10 000 years ago resulted in the increased monsoonal rains that explain the widespread expansion of lakes in now-desert basins. But in the American Southwest lake expansion dates to 18 000-15 000 years ago, when storm tracks were displaced to the south by the ice sheets - themselves a product of earlier orbital changes. The dynamics in the response of different components of the natural system to climatic change are recorded in the stratigraphy of lake sediments, not only by their pollen content as a manifestation of the regional vegetation but also by their microfossils and chemical composition as reflections of lake development.																			0921-2728					MAR	1996	15	2					119	127																WOS:A1996TZ57000001

We will report results for I-129/I ratios in volcanic fluids determined using accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) on samples collected from geothermal wells, crater lakes, fumaroles, hot springs and cold seeps in Central America, Japan and New Zealand. The results show not only the presence of recycled marine sediments in the main volcanic zones and in fore arc areas, but can also be used for the determination of the source location within the sediments. Very high iodine concentrations in fore are fluids together with ages compatible with subducting sediments suggest that remobilization in fore are areas might be an important process in the marine cycle of iodine and similar elements. Very low I-129/I ratios in some geothermal fluids in Central America document the influence of old crustal material on volcanic fluids.

J	Hussner, A; Windhaus, M; Starfinger, U				Hussner, A.; Windhaus, M.; Starfinger, U.			From weed biology to successful control: an example of successful management of Ludwigia grandiflora in Germany	WEED RESEARCH												Ludwigia grandiflora (water primrose), a native to the Americas, is one of the most important invasive alien aquatic plants in Europe. In Germany, a first population was found in an oxbow lake of the River Leda in Lower Saxony, north-western Germany, in 2004. Ludwigia grandiflora formed both dense monospecific patches and mixed stands with native plants. A study on the biology of L.grandiflora documented that the plants regrow in spring from vegetative means only, even though viable seed production occurred. Hand weeding was successfully tested in different sampling sites as a sustainable management tool and subsequently used for the management of this species. Within 3days, more than 99% of the biomass (25 tonnes of fresh mass) was harvested in 2013. Afterwards, a one-day post-treatment in the same year, two-one-day treatments in 2014 and one-one-day treatment in 2015 were made to harvest the regrown plants. After the first year, plant regrowth occurred only in one extremely muddy site, while in more than 99% of the water body, L.grandiflora was eradicated. Even though L.grandiflora was not completely eradicated from the water, a total eradication seems achievable within the next few years. The study documented the difficulties in the management of aquatic weeds, particularly in heterogeneous habitats with varying sediment structure. Management measures must be adapted to the infested habitat and species biology, which is mandatory for successful management of all aquatic weeds.					; Hussner, Andreas/P-7596-2016; Starfinger, Uwe/H-4492-2019	Starfinger, Uwe/0000-0001-5769-1445; Hussner, Andreas/0000-0003-0055-3417; 													0043-1737	1365-3180				DEC	2016	56	6					434	441		10.1111/wre.12224	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/wre.12224													WOS:000387359800004

The lake was originally filled with water, thanks to the channelling of a spring. Over time, the lowering of the water table and the high hydraulic permeability of the calcarenites have caused the lake to dry up. A project to renovate the monumental complex has recently been launched. It also provides the study of a possible restoration of the original conditions of the lake. To this end, a multidisciplinary geophysical study was carried out to investigate the geotechnical conditions of permeability of the land outcropping and provides valid technical solutions for waterproofing the bottom of the lake. For this purpose, a joint interpretation was performed using data acquired with different geophysical techniques, such as seismic refraction tomography, electrical resistivity and induced polarization tomography, multichannel analysis of surface waves and horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio of environmental vibration recording. Joint interpretation, supported by cluster analysis techniques, allowed the reconstruction of the geophysical and geotechnical model of the subsoil of the ancient lake, helpful to suggest appropriate techniques for waterproofing the bottom of the lake.

Chemical and physical factors associated with yellow perch abundance in Great Lakes coastal wetlands: patterns within and among wetland types	WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Great Lakes coastal wetlands provide important spawning and nursery habitat as well as abundant food resources for yellow perch (Perca flavescens). We examined multiple years of fyke-net data from wetlands along Lakes Huron and Michigan to describe yellow perch distribution in drowned river mouth (DRM) and coastal fringing systems. Principal components analysis and multi-response permutation procedures indicated that DRM wetlands (yellow perch CPUE = 0.2) were eutrophic systems that often exhibit high temperatures and periods of hypoxia, whereas coastal fringing wetlands (yellow perch CPUE = 32.1) were less productive. Among the coastal fringing systems, Saginaw Bay (Lake Huron), displayed characteristics of being more productive and had more yellow perch. Most yellow perch captured in Saginaw Bay were age-0, suggesting that it was an important nursery habitat. Among DRM ecosystems, we found that the downstream lake macrohabitats contained more yellow perch than upstream wetlands; however, there was no significant difference in abiotic characteristics to explain the higher catches in lakes. We hypothesize that yellow perch were more prevalent in wetlands with intermediate productivity during summer because these systems provide abundant food resources without the harsh conditions associated with highly eutrophic wetlands.

However, this approach did not result in the water quality desired. The algae-dominated turbid water state may be extremely stable, and then additional measures are necessary to remove certain 'blockages' such as: the persistent bloom of Oscillatoria algae, the P release from the lake sediments, and the abundance of fish, preventing zooplankton and submerged macrophytes from developing. This paper addresses: (1) the need for an ecosystem approach, (2) the resistance of shallow lake ecosystems to changes in nutrient loading, (3) the concept of stable states, buffers and switches, and (4) the perspectives for lake restoration in the Netherlands. Priority should be given to fighting the Oscillatoria blooms. Winter flushing with water low in TP and algae proved to be an effective tool for reducing these blooms. Reduction of planktivorous fish, such as bream and roach, could enhance the top-down control of algae through the grazing by zooplankton, particularly by the large Daphnia species. (C) 1998 IAWQ.

J	KANO, K				KANO, K			VOLCANICLASTIC SEDIMENTATION IN A SHALLOW-WATER MARGINAL BASIN - THE EARLY MIOCENE KOURA FORMATION, SW JAPAN	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												The Early Miocene Koura Formation, SW Japan is composed mainly of reworked volcaniclastics and andesite to rhyolite pyroclastics, and constitutes part of the volcanic zone of SW Japan of that time. Reworked volcaniclastics sequences are thick and mostly coarse-grained, and based on conventional facies concepts, are interpreted as shoreface to beach deposits, turbidites, and debris-flow deposits. Thick acid tuffs intercalated in the volcaniclastic sequences individually show internal features characteristics of either subaerial or subaqueous ash-flow emplacement, or in some cases both. Andesite pyroclastic facies include surge and fall deposits. Facies relationships, together with the fossil record, indicate deposition in a shallow lacustrine environment. The deposition rate of the Koura Formation was probably high enough to rapidly fill the shallow lake, but sedimentation was balanced by rapid subsidence of the lake, similar to lakes present within the modern volcanic zones of Taupo, New Zealand and Hohi, Japan. The Koura Formation grades upward into marine deposits, and may represent the initial volcanism and volcaniclastic sedimentation during the early stages of back-arc or intra-arc rifting.																			0037-0738					NOV	1991	74	1-4					309	321		10.1016/0037-0738(91)90070-T	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0037-0738(91)90070-T													WOS:A1991GX10600015

Taxonomic diversity of extremophilic prokaryotes adapted to special environmental parameters in Hungary: a review	BIOLOGIA FUTURA												The taxonomic and metabolic diversity of prokaryotes and their adaptability to extreme environmental parameters have allowed extremophiles to find their optimal living conditions under extreme conditions for one or more environmental parameters. Natural habitats abundant in extremophilic microorganisms are relatively rare in Hungary. Nevertheless, alkaliphiles and halophiles can flourish in shallow alkaline lakes (soda pans) and saline (solonetz) soils, where extreme weather conditions favor the development of unique bacterial communities. In addition, the hot springs and thermal wells that supply spas and thermal baths and provide water for energy use are suitable colonization sites for thermophiles and hyperthermophiles. Polyextremophiles, adapted to multiple extreme circumstances, can be found in the aphotic, nutrient-poor and radioactive hypogenic caves of the Buda Thermal Karst, among others. The present article reviews the organization, taxonomic composition, and potential role of different extremophilic bacterial communities in local biogeochemical cycles, based on the most recent studies on extremophiles in Hungary.

J	Polvi, LE				Polvi, L. E.			Morphodynamics of Boulder-Bed Semi-Alluvial Streams in Northern Fennoscandia: A Flume Experiment to Determine Sediment Self-Organization	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												In northern Fennoscandia, semi-alluvial boulder-bed channels with coarse glacial legacy sediment are abundant, and due to widespread anthropogenic manipulation during timber-floating, unimpacted reference reaches are rare. The landscape context of these semi-alluvial rapids-with numerous mainstem lakes that buffer high flows and sediment connectivity in addition to a regional low sediment yield-contribute to low amounts of fine sediment and incompetent flows to transport boulders. To determine the morphodynamics of semi-alluvial rapids and potential self-organization of sediment with multiple high flows, a flume experiment was designed and carried out to mimic conditions in semi-alluvial rapids in northern Fennoscandia. Two slope setups (2% and 5%) were used to model a range of flows (Q(1) (summer high flow), Q(2), Q(10), and Q(50)) in a 8 x 1.1 m flume with a sediment distribution analogous to field conditions; bed topography was measured using structure-from-motion photogrammetry after each flow to obtain DEMs. No classic steep coarse-bed channel bedforms (e.g., step-pools) developed. However, similarly to boulder-bed channels with low relative submergence, at Q(10) and Q(50) flows, sediment deposited upstream of boulders and scoured downstream. Because the Q(50) flow was not able to rework the channel by disrupting grain-interlocking from preceding lower flows, transporting boulders, or forming channel-spanning boulders, the channel-forming discharge is larger than the Q(50). These results have implications for restoration of gravel spawning beds in northern Fennoscandia and highlight the importance of large grains in understanding channel morphodynamics.

J	Régnière, J; Nealis, VG				Regniere, Jacques; Nealis, Vince G.			The analysis of the survival of small larvae in the unsprayed area	ECOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY												1. A lagged, density-dependent relationship between survival of early instars and host-tree condition is revealed during outbreaks of spruce budworm, Choristoneura fumiferana Clem. Persistent damage to hosts leads to deterioration of the stand. 2. Resource limitation affects survival during early-instar dispersal of spruce budworm. Impediments to distinguishing these events with estimates of survival were overcome with a simple model that describes the dispersal and survival processes. The model was used to analyse a recent 15-year population series from Black Sturgeon Lake and two historical datasets from Green River, in Canada. 3. Defoliation-induced damage to the trees resulted in increased losses of spring-emerging larvae that are dispersing in search of feeding sites. Losses were further exacerbated by biotic factors such as maternal fecundity, rates of infection by the pathogen, Nosema fumiferanae, and by weather-related effects on the foraging period. 4. Survival of early-stage budworm larvae in persistent outbreaks declined and the likelihood of other density-related factors such as rate of mortality from natural enemies increased. These results may reconcile outstanding differences in interpretation of the role of the forest resource in spruce budworm population dynamics and point to a common process linking the dynamics of other well-known budworm species.																			0307-6946					JUN	2008	33	3					362	373		10.1111/j.1365-2311.2007.00977.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2311.2007.00977.x													WOS:000255456000006
J	Ramesh, R				Ramesh, R			High resolution Holocene monsoon records from different proxies: An assessment of their consistency	CURRENT SCIENCE												Available high resolution quantitative monsoon reconstructions for the Holocene period in the Indian region are compared to assess for consistency among the proxy records. There is a good concordance among three different monsoon proxies from western India: (a) Pollen-based reconstruction of annual rainfall in Rajasthan from a sediment core in lake Lunkaransar, (b) stable carbon isotope variations in organic carbon from another core from the same lake, and (c) stable oxygen isotopic variations in surface-dwelling foraminifera from a sediment core in the coastal eastern Arabian Sea. While this is reassuring, the degree of concordance diminishes when records from widely separated sites in the Indian region are compared. Possible causes for this inconsistency are discussed, perhaps the most important among them being the large spatial variations in monsoon rainfall over the Indian region, apparent in modern instrumental records. There is a need to assess the temporal variance of this geographical variability before multiproxy quantitative monsoon rainfall reconstructions can be integrated as a single time series (somewhat akin to the modern All India Summer Monsoon Rainfall time series compiled by the India Meteorological Department). Such an effort can serve to test and improve palaeoclimate/palaeomonsoon models.																			0011-3891					DEC 10	2001	81	11					1432	1436																WOS:000172794500023
J	OLAFSSON, J				OLAFSSON, J			CHEMICAL CHARACTERISTICS AND TRACE-ELEMENTS OF THINGVALLAVATN	OIKOS												Thingvallavatn receives inflow of cold and warm groundwater as well as surface drainage. The inflowing waters are divided into 7 groups according to region or compositional characteristics and the discharge of each group is estimated. The input of P, N and Si with the inflow is 0.8, 1.4 and 240 g m-2 yr-1 respectively. Owing to its density, the voluminous cold groundwater flow which enters the northern part of the lake tends, in mid summer, to follow the lake floor into the deep basin. Primary production appears to be N limited but there are variations between years in the utilization of Si. Extensive development of geothermal resources at Nesjavellir at SW Thingvallavatn brings to the surface environment water and gas including potentially toxic or harmful elements. The effluents either enter the atmosphere, a surface brook or are pumped underground. The quantities of various trace elements are evaluated. It is concluded that before the chemicals reach the lake they are lost to the atmosphere, modified by reactions and diluted to such an extent that there is little cause for concern except possibly in the case of arsenic, which should be monitored.																			0030-1299					MAY-JUN	1992	64	1-2					151	161		10.2307/3545050	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3545050													WOS:A1992JG50900013
J	Hill, CA; Ranney, WD				Hill, C. A.; Ranney, W. D.			A proposed Laramide proto-Grand Canyon	GEOMORPHOLOGY												The absence of "rim gravels" north of Grand Canyon and of "Canaan Peak-type" gravels south of Grand Canyon suggests that a paleocanyon, which intersected the transport of these gravels north and south, may have begun forming in the Laramide in approximately the same position as today's central Grand Canyon. This Laramide-age canyon is envisioned as having flowed generally from the SW to NE; from the Peach Springs Canyon area to Mile 197 where it was captured by karst; then along a N. 60 degrees E joint system to the Kanab Point area where it converged with drainage coming off the west side of the Kaibab arch. From there it flowed north along the west flank of the Kaibab arch to Paleogene Lake Claron. The critical idea suggested by this proposed model is that the modern Colorado River utilized Laramide paleotopography in establishing its course through the central Grand Canyon, with younger sections of the canyon integrating with it later, in the middle to late Miocene. This paleocanyon route, in association with headward erosion from the Grand Wash Cliffs toward the Kaibab arch after 16-17 Ma, helps account for the total volume of rock eroded from Grand Canyon, which cannot be explained by present-day incision rates.

In the present study, we examined the distribution of organic pollutants (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons [PAHs], non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]) in Lake Balaton, the largest shallow lake of Central Europe. We also investigated the sensitivity of the invasive quagga mussel to these substances and its potential to reduce their concentration in the water column. Our findings show that organic pollutant levels in Lake Balaton were generally below concentrations known to harm mussels, as indicated by the stress gene activity patterns observed along the lake's longitudinal axis. However, in the most urbanized eastern part of the lake, especially in spring, we detected signs of environmental contamination from certain pollutants (e.g. diclofenac), highlighting potential risks to local ecosystems and communities. Removal capacity of the mussels for PAHs reached the maximum after four days of exposure to 5-10 % diluted water accommodated fraction of fuel-oil fraction #4 when the mussels (20 ind. L-1) reduced the PAH level by 100-85 %. Mussels (50 ind. L- 1) removed 28 % and 21 % of ibuprofen and ketoprofen, respectively, from 1 mu g L- 1 concentrated solutions within 24 h. Many of the stress response genes were activated in the quagga mussel after their exposure to PAHs. These results suggest a significant role of gregarious invasive bivalves in the removal of organic pollutants from lake water.

The mass extinction of fish in the middle and lower section of the Oder was probably the result of such environmental conditions. Because algae bloom is correlated with an increase in the content of chlorophyll in the river and on its surface, the authors focused on an analysis of changes in the chlorophyll amount in the longitudinal profile of the river. The key data was obtained by soundings carried out at an interval of about one kilometre during the research expedition, which took place on July 16-24, 2022. These data coincided with the values of the NDVI index (normalised difference vegetation index) based on 10-metre satellite images from the Sentinel 2 mission. Imagery from cloudless periods (mainly March, June, July and August) processed using the NDVI index was compared. Regularly elevated chlorophyll levels in the upstream section (occurring in each period) and temporarily elevated chlorophyll values as moving downstream were observed. This article confirms the initial conclusions of Kolada et al. (2022) that the mass fish kill in the Oder River in the summer of 2022 was condi-tioned by natural environmental pressure causing massive algae bloom and the release of their toxins. The article also proves that the use of satellite images for this type of analysis is the correct approach, but due to low resolution, they cannot be used as reference material. Changes in the hydrobiological parameters of the river, which are a direct indicator of the causes of the ecological disaster, are the data of the multi-parameter probe obtained two weeks before the first mass catches of dead fish.					; Matysik, Magdalena/AAH-6936-2019; Absalon, Damian/A-1139-2011	Matysik, Magdalena/0000-0002-5424-5703; Woznica, Andrzej/0000-0003-3051-1816; Absalon, Damian/0000-0001-7504-4962; Janczewska, Natalia/0000-0002-5121-6886													1470-160X	1872-7034				APR	2023	148								110103	10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.110103	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.110103		MAR 2023											WOS:000952200100001

Eggs were found attached to seagrasses and seaweeds in the densely vegetated eastern inner lake. Larvae (7.1-34.9 mm total length) were distributed in the less densely vegetated inner lake during April and June. Juveniles (35.0-89.6 mm) were collected in the central and western parts of the lake. The sites containing juveniles were less densely vegetated with water temperatures lower than 20 A degrees C from June to August. When the water temperature of the entire lake rose to 20 A degrees C in late summer, juveniles appeared to move from the lake to the bottom layer of Akkeshi Bay, which has lower temperatures. Thus, in Akkeshi waters, C. pallasii successively used different habitats during its egg, larval and juvenile stages. A comparison of the current limited distribution of eggs and larvae with the distribution over the entire lake and bay areas in the 1950s and 1960s (periods of large catch size) indicates that the spawning grounds and larval habitats of C. pallasii have contracted to the lake area due to low spawning stock biomass in recent years.																			0919-9268	1444-2906				MAR	2018	84	2					227	236		10.1007/s12562-018-1175-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12562-018-1175-8													WOS:000427098900008

A new approach for reconstructing glacier variability based on lake sediments recording input from more than one glacier	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												We explore the possibility of building a continuous glacier reconstruction by analyzing the integrated sedimentary response of a large (440 km(2)) glacierized catchment in western Norway, as recorded in the downstream lake Nerfloen (N61 degrees 56', E6 degrees 52'). A multi-proxy numerical analysis demonstrates that it is possible to distinguish a glacier component in the similar to 8000-yr-long record, based on distinct changes in grain size, geo-chemistry, and magnetic composition. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) reveals a strong common signal in the 15 investigated sedimentary parameters, with the first principal component explaining 77% of the total variability. This signal is interpreted to reflect glacier activity in the upstream catchment, an interpretation that is independently tested through a mineral magnetic provenance analysis of catchment samples. Minimum glacier input is indicated between 6700-5700 cal yr BP, probably reflecting a situation when most glaciers in the catchment had melted away, whereas the highest glacier activity is observed around 600 and 200 cal yr BP. During the local Neoglacial interval (similar to 4200 cal yr BP until present), five individual periods of significantly reduced glacier extent are identified at similar to 3400, 3000-2700, 2100-2000, 1700-1500, and similar to 900 cal yr BP.

Our objectives were: (1) to identify hydrologic and climatic variables that explain variations in mechanical breakup magnitude at the watershed scale, (2) to organize these variables in terms of importance and (3) to construct a predictive model for ice-floods in the Necopastic watershed. We used parametric correlation analysis to measure the degree of linear association between variables and classification trees (CT) coupled with a cross-validation approach to construct the predictive model and to organize variables according to their importance. In the Necopastic watershed, the type and magnitude of breakups are determined by an interaction between forces that maintain the ice cover in place and forces that tend to dislodge it. In contrast with lakes, early and rapidly rising floods, rather than abnormally high flood discharge, create conditions that favour intense mechanical breakups. Moreover, cold and snowy spring conditions during high positive Arctic Oscillation (AO) indices delay the thermal degradation of the ice cover and preserve its mechanical properties over longer time periods.

Temporal and spatial characteristics of snowstorms in the contiguous United States	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY												A climatological analysis of snowstorms across the contiguous United States, based on data from 1222 weather stations with data during 1901-2001, defined the spatial and temporal features. The average annual incidence of events creating 15.2 cm or more in 1 or 2 days, which are termed as snowstorms, exhibits great spatial variability. The pattern is latitudinal across most of the eastern half of the United States, averaging 0.1 storm (1 storm per 10 years) in the Deep South, increasing to 2 storms along the Canadian border. This pattern is interrupted by higher averages downwind of the Great Lakes and in the Appalachian Mountains. In the western third of the United States where snow falls, lower-elevation sites average 0.1-2 storms per year, but averages are much higher in the Cascade Range and Rocky Mountains, where 5-30 storms occur per year. Most areas of the United States have had years without snowstorms, but the annual minima are 1 or more storms in high-elevation areas of the West and Northeast. The pattern of annual maxima of storms is similar to the average pattern. The temporal distribution of snowstorms exhibited wide fluctuations during 1901-2000, with downward 100-yr trends in the lower Midwest, South, and West Coast. Upward trends occurred in the upper Midwest, East, and Northeast, and the national trend for 1901-2000 was upward, corresponding to trends in strong cyclonic activity. The peak periods of storm activity in the United States occurred during 1911-20 and 1971-80, and the lowest frequency was in 1931-40. Snowstorms first occur in September in the Rockies, in October in the high plains, in November across most of the United States, and in December in the Deep South. The month with the season's last storms is December in the South and then shifts northward, with April the last month of snowstorms across most of the United States. Storms occur as late as May and June in the Rockies and Cascades. Snowstorms are most frequent in December downwind of the Great Lakes, with the peak of activity in January for most other areas of the United States.																			1558-8424	1558-8432				AUG	2006	45	8					1141	1155		10.1175/JAM2395.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JAM2395.1													WOS:000240622200008

How Does Changing Ice-Out Affect Arctic versus Boreal Lakes? A Comparison Using Two Years with Ice-Out that Differed by More Than Three Weeks	WATER												The timing of lake ice-out has advanced substantially in many regions of the Northern Hemisphere, however the effects of ice-out timing on lake properties and how they vary regionally remain unclear. Using data from two inter-annual monitoring datasets for a set of three Arctic lakes and one boreal lake, we compared physical, chemical and phytoplankton metrics from two years in which ice-out timing differed by at least three weeks. Our results revealed regional differences in lake responses during early compared to late ice-out years. With earlier ice-out, Arctic lakes had deeper mixing depths and the boreal lake had a shallower mixing depth, suggesting differing patterns in the influence of the timing of ice-out on the length of spring turnover. Differences in nutrient concentrations and dissolved organic carbon between regions and ice-out years were likely driven by changes in precipitation and permafrost thaw. Algal biomass was similar across ice-out years, while cell densities of key Cyclotella sensu lato taxa were strongly linked to thermal structure changes in the Arctic lakes. Our research provides evidence that Arctic and boreal regions differ in lake response in early and late ice-out years, however ultimately a combination of important climate factors such as solar insolation, air temperature, precipitation, and, in the Arctic, permafrost thaw, are key drivers of the observed responses.					; Fowler, Rachel/JFA-1083-2023	Northington, Robert/0000-0002-1347-0971; Warner, Kate/0000-0002-7664-051X; Fowler, Rachel/0000-0002-4906-6372; 													2073-4441					JAN	2018	10	1							78	10.3390/w10010078	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w10010078													WOS:000424397400075

The present work also contains an analysis of possible effects of gypsum application for water from the reservoir, on the basis of selected parameters of overlying water. Undisturbed deposit cores extracted from two research stations on the Solina Reservoir have been a subject to a 10-weeks long exposure in determinate conditions, after application of gypsum. The conducted research indicated that retention capacities of deposits, which become increased after the use of gypsum, will decrease over time (e.g. after winter period). Application of gypsum led to a quite significant increase in concentrations of calcium in solutions. Intense release of iron from the sediments into the solutions and decrease in SO42- content, during the said 10-week exposure in anoxic conditions, indicates the use of iron (III) and sulphates as electron acceptors in process of oxidization of an organic substance.																			2299-8993					JAN	2017	18	1					238	245		10.12911/22998993/67103	http://dx.doi.org/10.12911/22998993/67103													WOS:000416832100030

In addition, 109 whitefish (Coregonus sp.) were studied from one of the lakes. Four ergasilid species were found: (the prevalence and intensity/fish, respectively, for the whole material are given in parentheses) Ergasilus briani (16.9%, 0.5), Neoergasilus japonicus (15.6%, 0.4) and Paraergasilus longidigitus (2.1%, 0.02) on the roach and Ergasilus sieboldi (9.9%, 0.1)and P. longidigitus (4.9%, 0.05) on the perch. Logit analysis was used to assess the significance of the year, the lake and the season for the prevalence of infection. Generally, the prevalence of E. briani on roach depended on the season only, with higher prevalences in summer. That of E. sieboldi on perch was mainly dependent on the lake, being most frequent in the oligotrophic lake. Both lake, year and season affected the prevalence of N. japonicus in roach. The more complicated system for N. japonicus was explained by the long duration of its free-living stage, its loose attachment and different location on the host, being found on the fins whereas E. briani and E. sieboldi were on the gills. All species were found throughout the year, and age had no clear influence on infection. The occurrence of egg-sacs and length distributions of the copepods suggest that there are two generations a year, e.g. an overwintering E. briani generation which produces offspring in June to attack the fish in July, and a second generation which attacks the fish from August onwards. Whitefish were not infected by these parasites, only one fish being found which carried a single individual of E. sieboldi.

Quaternary lacustrine carbonate deposits of the Great Basin, USA: Impact of climate, tectonics and substrate	SEDIMENTOLOGY												The Great Basin included several lacustrine systems that accommodated extensive carbonate buildups: the Lahontan on the western side (dating back to 48 kyr cal bp), and the Bonneville (from 30 to 11.5 kyr cal bp) and Great Salt Lake (starting 11.5 kyr cal bp) on the eastern side of the basin. The eastern lakes show a transition from freshwater to hypersaline conditions. In contrast, the western lakes do not show any significant change from the originally prevailing freshwater conditions. Mapping of the carbonate buildups in the different lakes settings enables a comparison of a biotic versus an abiotic composition of the carbonate buildups, their morphologies and their specific spatial distributions. The morphology, size and distribution of the carbonate deposits are predominantly governed by seasonal to long-term water level fluctuations, particular geomorphological heritage, fault-induced processes, groundwater seepage and substrates. All of the lakes show a palaeoshoreline distribution with some buildups containing crusts, hemispheroid domes, and parts of complex domes resulting from climate-induced lake level variations. However, the presence of columns and complex domes made up of mixed biotic/abiotic carbonates in the western Great Basin is related to the influx of groundwater. Winnemucca Lake and Pyramid Lake contain bigger buildups than the ones observed in the eastern Great Basin lakes. The presence of these large size buildups and thinolites in the Lahontan lacustrine system are a consequence of local hydrological processes associated with influenced groundwater flows through specific sedimentary structures (for example, from springs and delta fronts) and faults. This contrast in the distribution, composition and size of the buildups between the two sides of the Great Basin suggests local changes in water chemistry (for example, [Ca2+]) and groundwater influxes. This work provides a novel conceptual model for the formation of abiotic and/or biotic carbonate buildups in lacustrine settings.

The spatiotemporal distribution patterns of TSS concentrations in summer in the Peace-Athabasca Delta (PAD) remain unclear between 2000 and 2020. Among empirical and machine learning models, the random forest (RF) model exhibits the best performance for the PAD with a coefficient of determination, normalized root-means-square error, and relative root-mean-square error of 0.92, 7.51%, and 27.36%, respectively. Our study analyzes the spatiotemporal TSS distribution based on 21 years of Landsat remote sensing data and the RF model. The results showed that the TSS concentrations of the Peace River were elevated in 2000, 2016, 2019, and 2020. The long-term TSS concentration distribution in the PAD showed a decreasing trend from west to east, and the TSS concentrations ranged from 6 to 80 mg/L level and remained stable in Lake Athabasca during the investigated period. Moreover, 57.14% of the PAD area exhibited no significant change between 2000 and 2020. The results of our study provide detailed information for the local government on the TSS concentrations in the PAD.

J	Gasparon, M; Burgess, JS				Gasparon, M; Burgess, JS			Human impacts in Antarctica trace-element geochemistry of freshwater lakes in the Larsemann Hills, East Antarctica	ENVIRONMENTAL GEOLOGY												Fresh water lakes are found in basement rock basins in the Larsemann Hills, East Antarctica, during the summer months. These lakes constitute a relatively simple natural laboratory to investigate the effects of recent and well-documented anthropogenic impact on a "pristine" environment. Larsemann Hills freshwaters have extremely low salinity (typically <1 parts per thousand), and contain very low concentrations of trace elements of environmental significance such as Pb, U, and Zn. Typical Pb concentrations range from less than 5 ppt to 250 ppt. Although trace metal concentrations appear to be higher in lakes situated in the vicinity of stations, they are consistently lower (by several orders of magnitude, for some elements) than Standard International Drinking Water Guidelines. The chemistry of the lake waters is dominated by sea-spray input. Consequently, it is primarily a function of geographical factors, such as distance from the shore and exposure to winds. Shallow-level groundwater and surface water also contribute to the lake chemistry. No evidence was found for contamination from global air circulation. Although contamination resulting from activities at the research stations is generally near or below detection levels, very low levels of trace metal anthropogenic contamination were found in the vicinity of some research stations.																			0943-0105					JUL	2000	39	9					963	976		10.1007/s002549900010	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s002549900010													WOS:000088391600001

A Bayesian hierarchical model to guide development and evaluation of substance objectives under the 2012 Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Under the 2012 Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement Canada and the United States are obliged to develop target concentrations for water quality constituents of particular concern. These "substance objectives" are closely analogous to numerical criteria under the US Clean Water Act. To develop effective substance objectives, it is important to consider how compliance with these objectives will be evaluated. Total phosphorus concentrations, for example, vary temporally and spatially, thus sample-based statistics will always be uncertain measures of the "true" underlying population characteristic. Using data from Saginaw Bay in Lake Huron, we develop a Bayesian hierarchical model that can be used to evaluate compliance with target concentrations on a temporally and spatially explicit basis. The "confidence of compliance" with targets can be assessed from the variance of the model parameter posterior distributions. This approach allows data to be grouped to represent spatial and temporal domains of particular interest, such as spring mean conditions in a certain area, and facilitates "partial pooling" of information so that regions with sparse data and high uncertainty can "borrow information" from more data-rich areas.

The mid to late summer build-up of metaphyton was extensive in both lakes, affecting nearly 100% of the lake perimeters, being concentrated in a shallow band 0.5-1.0 m deep in L302S and 0.4-2.7 m deep in Plastic Lake. Distribution was negatively related to depth and bottom slope but independent of type of substratum. The areal density of metaphyton in the 0-2 m depth zone of Plastic Lake was estimated to be 1.2 g dry weight (dw) .cntdot. m-2. The productivity of metaphyton standardized by biomass was inversely related to the concentration of algae incubated.

J	Fukuzaki, N				Fukuzaki, Norio			Seasonal Variation of Arsenic Concentration in Lake Water of Sakata Lagoon	BUNSEKI KAGAKU												Sakata lagoon, a sand-dammed dune lake fed by only spring water and precipitation, is located in Niigata City. The inflow water from the upper lagoon, Kami-sakata, and the outflow water to the general river, were collected biweekly 152 times over a period ranging from February 2011 to January 2017, respectively. The total arsenic (T-As) and other parameters (temperature, pH, ORP, main ionic components including HCO3-, iron, and manganese) were measured. Based on the temporal variations, seasonal comparisons and factor analysis, the following conclusions were obtained: 1) The concentration of T-As increased in the warm season, and sometimes exceeded the environmental standard value of 10 mu g L-1. Approximately, 80 % of the T-As is present in the soluble form. 2) The ORP of outflow water decreased during the warm seasons to approximately 86 % of that during the cold seasons. Further, during warm seasons, the concentrations of NO3- and SO42- significantly decreased, and the concentrations of HCO3- in both the inflow and outflow water remarkably increase during warm season. 3) The increase in the concentration of T-As during the warm season is considered to be caused by the reduced adsorption affinity of As onto the organic matter and/or Fe(III) hydroxide in the lake sediments. Biological activities in the sediments may induce the decomposition of organic matter and a decreased ORP; the increased concentration of HCO3- and pH occurred mainly in outflow water, which affords the following decreased adsorption affinity of As.																			0525-1931					SEP	2018	67	9					557	564		10.2116/bunsekikagaku.67.557	http://dx.doi.org/10.2116/bunsekikagaku.67.557													WOS:000445994100006

Typically reaction time scales are much shorter than turbulence timescales. In biological applications, as it is the case for bacterial and plankton populations living under the influence of currents in oceans and lakes, the typical lifetime can be long and thus can fall well within the inertial range of turbulence time scales. Under these conditions, turbulent transport interacts in a very complex way with the dynamics of growth and death of the individuals in the population. In the present paper, we quantitatively investigate the effect of the flow compressibility on the dynamics of populations. Small effective compressibility can be induced by several physical mechanisms, such as, e.g., by the density mismatch, by a small but finite size of microorganisms, and by gyrotaxis (an interaction between swimming and shear). We report, for the first time, how even a tiny effective compressibility can produce a dramatically large effect on global quantities like the carrying capacity of the ecosystem. We interpret our findings by means of a cumulative effect made possible by the long replication times of the organisms with respect to turbulence time scales. A statistical quantification of the fluctuations of population concentration is presented.

Nine morphological stati, all referable to M. aeruginosa f. aeruginosa, feature at various stages of the cycle. Summer bloom-forming populations originate from vegetative colonial stock that overwinters on the bottom sediment each year, but there is no mass transfer of these colonies to the water column: intensive growth from individual cells in the old colonies leads to the formation of new infective colonies, being stimulated when the bottom water approaches anoxia and light penetrates to the bottom sediments. Growth is slow but the developing populations sustain only minor losses through grazing and settling out, eventually becoming dominant over other species. Allelopathy possibly contributes to this effect. In post-maximal populations, several mechanisms can contribute to net buoyancy loss and a (usually) rapid recruitment of vegetative colonies to the sediments is observed. Hypotheses are advanced to account for the observed behavior, and some of these have been tested in the laboratory. The apparent physiological flexibility of Microcystis seems well suited to growth and survival in the microenvironments encountered in eutrophic lakes.																			0962-8436	1471-2970					1981	293	1068					419	477		10.1098/rstb.1981.0081	http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rstb.1981.0081													WOS:A1981LZ05100001

Biogeochemical cycling and ecological thresholds in a High Arctic lake (Svalbard)	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Lakes are a dominant feature of the Arctic landscape and a focal point of regional and global biogeochemical cycling. We collected a sediment core from a High Arctic Lake in southwestern Svalbard for multiproxy paleolimnological analysis. The aim was to find linkages between the terrestrial and aquatic environments in the context of climate change to understand centennial-long Arctic biogeochemical cycling and environmental dynamics. Two significant thresholds in elemental cycling were found based on sediment physical and biogeochemical proxies that were associated with the end of the cold Little Ice Age and the recent warming. We found major shifts in diatom, chironomid and cladoceran communities and their functionality that coincided with increased summer temperatures since the 1950s. We also discovered paleoecological evidence that point toward expanded bird (Little Auk) colonies in the catchment alongside climate warming. Apparently, climate-driven increase in glacier melt water delivery as well as a prolonged snow- and ice-free period have increased the transport of mineral matter from the catchment, causing significant water turbidity and disappearance of several planktonic diatoms and clear-water chironomids. We also found sedimentary accumulation of microplastic particles following the increase in Little Auk populations suggesting that seabirds potentially act as biovectors for plastic contamination. Our study demonstrates the diverse nature of climate-driven changes in the Arctic lacustrine environment with increased inorganic input from the more exposed catchment, larger nutrient delivery from the increased bird colonies at the surrounding mountain summits and subsequent alterations in aquatic communities.

Measurements of the oxygen isotopic composition of water extracted under stepped pyrolysis from a bulk sample of this meteorite have allowed us to make comparisons with similar data obtained from CI and CM chondrites and so further investigate any relationships that may exist between these meteorites. The much lower yield of water bearing a terrestrial signature in Tagish Lake is indicative of the pristine nature of the meteorite. The relationship between the isotopic composition of this water and reported isotopic values for carbonates, bulk matrix and whole rock have been used to infer the extent and conditions under which parent-body aqueous alteration occurred. In Tagish Lake the difference in Delta(17)O isotopic composition between the water and other phases is greater than that found in either CM or CI chondrites suggesting that reaction and isotopic exchange between components was more limited. This in turn suggests that in the case of Tagish Lake conditions during the processes of aqueous alteration on the parent body, which ultimately controlled the formation of new minerals, were distinct from those on both CI and CM parent bodies.

The evidence suggested that the decline was caused by heavy summer mortalities in 1940 and 1941, but further study indicated that the summer mortalities had involved mainly older fish and that the primary cause for the decline was a scarcity of young fish in the population at the time of mortalities. Accordingly, our efforts were turned toward a search for the cause of weak year-classes, or year-class fluctuations in general. It was postulated that year-class failures might arise if the eggs hatched under the ice because then the illumination would be insufficient to enable the larval cisco to feed. Experiments were conducted in the laboratory to determine the effects of illumination and of various patterns of incubation temperatures on the date of hatching of the eggs. Eggs exposed continuously to room illumination for 135 to 140 days hatched 7 to 8 days earlier than eggs incubated continuously in darkness. Different values of incubation temperatures acting on the eggs for about one month from the time of fertilization induced the expected proportional rates of development of eggs, but when the eggs were refrigerated at a common temperature after this first month, the rate of development of advanced embryos was retarded while the less developed embryos gained. Under such treatment, eggs incubated at temperatures differing by 1[degree]C in the range 1[degree]-6[degree]C, and then incubated for the remainder of the period at a common temperature below 4[degree]C, hatched about one day apart. Eggs incubated from the time of fertilization at a common temperature below 3[degree]C, and then incubated for the last month at higher temperatures differing by 1[degree]C in the range 1[degree]-6[degree]C, hatched 7 days apart. Eggs which had developed rapidly toward the hatching stage lay dormant for about 3 months at temperatures below 3[degree]C. They hatched about 4 days earlier than eggs incubated continuously at temperatures below 3[degree]C, having accumulated about 150 degree-days greater exposure. The evidence clearly indicated that the eggs of the cisco in Lake Mendota never hatch under the ice regardless of natural seasonal variations in temperatures and illumination incurred during the incubation period. Moreover, the dates of hatching are probably not affected significantly by any factor except possibly different temperatures incurred after the departure of the ice from year to year. Experiments conducted on larval cisco indicated that they require illumination for feeding. They starve if held in darkness with natural densities of food. They begin to swallow water on the first day after hatching as indicated by keeping them in a solution of 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride. They also begin to swallow partic-ulate materials within the first day. By the third day they began to consume adult Cyclops sp. and by the fifth day better than 90% of the larval fish fed on adult Cyclops sp. During the first week, the swimming ability of the food organisms was a decisive factor in the degree of feeding success shown by the larval fish. The test consisted of offering living Cyclops sp. to one group of fish and freshly killed Cyclops sp. to the other group. After the first week, the fish fed equally well on both types of food. The larval fish tolerated about 108-120 degree-days of starvation without harm. Yet, when provided with food they began to feed before the yolk sac was absorbed. The initial postulated cause for year-class failures has been disproved. It is estimated that the eggs never hatch prior to April 25, and since 1880 the ice has not remained on Lake Mendota later than April 21.																			0024-3590	1939-5590					1956	1	3					176	194		10.4319/lo.1956.1.3.0176	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1956.1.3.0176													WOS:A1956WY35600004

(Salt Lake City, Utah, USA), is actively researching the application of solid oxide fuel cell technology as electrolyzers for large scale hydrogen and syngas production. This technology relies upon electricity and high temperature heat to chemically reduce a steam or steam / CO(2) feedstock. Single button cell tests, multi-cell stack, as well as multi-stack testing has been conducted. Stack testing used 10 x 10 cm cells (8 x 8 cm active area) supplied by Ceramatec and ranged from 10 cell short stacks to 240 cell modules. Tests were conducted either in a bench-scale test apparatus or in a newly developed 5 kW Integrated Laboratory Scale (ILS) test facility. Gas composition, operating voltage, and operating temperature were varied during testing. The tests were heavily instrumented, and outlet gas compositions were monitored with a gas chromatograph. The ILS facility is currently being expanded to similar to 15 kW testing capacity (H(2) production rate based upon lower heating value).																					978-0-7918-4855-5				2009							497	508																WOS:000266155300058

Extreme drought and flooding events are predicted to occur with greater frequency, requiring mitigation strategies to reduce their negative impacts. Multi-purpose local farm water retention systems can reduce water stress during drought periods by supporting irrigation. The retention systems' capture of excess spring runoff and extreme rainfall events also reduces flood potential downstream. Retention systems may also be used for biomass production and nutrient retention. A sub-watershed scale retention system was analysed using a dynamic simulation model to predict the economic advantages in the future. Irrigated crops using water from the downstream reservoir at Pelly's Lake, Manitoba, Canada, experienced a net decrease in gross margin in the future due to the associated irrigation and reservoir infrastructure costs. However, the multi-purpose benefits of the retention system at Pelly's Lake of avoided flood damages, nutrient retention, carbon sequestration, and biomass production provide an economic benefit of $25,507.00/hectare of retention system/year. Multi-purpose retention systems under future climate uncertainty provide economic and environmental gains when used to avoid flood damages, for nutrient retention and carbon sequestration, and biomass production. The revenue gained from these functions can support farmers willing to invest in irrigation while providing economic and environmental benefits to the region.					; Yassin, Fuad/AAA-7810-2021; Lindenschmidt, Karl-Erich/AFM-9194-2022	Lindenschmidt, Karl-Erich/0000-0001-6348-2295; Berry, Pam/0000-0002-1201-072X; Yassin, Dr. Fuad/0000-0001-8179-7928														2071-1050				MAR	2017	9	3							456	10.3390/su9030456	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su9030456													WOS:000398714100132

The succession adds significantly to the knowledge and understanding of the Sinemurian sedimentary evolution of the Fennoscandian Border Zone and the north-eastern margin of the Danish Basin. The top of the section overlaps the base of a section previously exposed at the nearby quarry at Gantofta. The combined evidence from Orby, Gantofta and a few borings shows that Sinemurian sedimentation took place during marked stepwise transgression. This is recorded by backstepping of the depositional environments from braided streams, over lakes and swamps, to estuarine and finally fully marine, offshore conditions. The sedimentary packages of the individual systems are well defined and separated mainly by sharp boundaries representing lacustrine, estuarine and marine flooding and ravinement surfaces. A regional sea-level rise punctuated by a minor fall is suggested to be the main factor controlling Early Jurassic basin evolution of the northeastern margin of the Danish Basin and the Fennoscandian Border Zone.																			2245-7070					DEC	1999	46		1				1	12																WOS:000204235800001
J	Teufel, B; Sushama, L				Teufel, Bernardo; Sushama, Laxmi			2 °C vs. High Warming: Transitions to Flood-Generating Mechanisms across Canada	WATER												Fluvial flooding in Canada is often snowmelt-driven, thus occurs mostly in spring, and has caused billions of dollars in damage in the past decade alone. In a warmer climate, increasing rainfall and changing snowmelt rates could lead to significant shifts in flood-generating mechanisms. Here, projected changes to flood-generating mechanisms in terms of the relative contribution of snowmelt and rainfall are assessed across Canada, based on an ensemble of transient climate change simulations performed using a state-of-the-art regional climate model. Changes to flood-generating mechanisms are assessed for both a late 21st century, high warming (i.e., Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5) scenario, and in a 2 degrees C global warming context. Under 2 degrees C of global warming, the relative contribution of snowmelt and rainfall to streamflow peaks is projected to remain close to that of the current climate, despite slightly increased rainfall contribution. In contrast, a high warming scenario leads to widespread increases in rainfall contribution and the emergence of hotspots of change in currently snowmelt-dominated regions across Canada. In addition, several regions in southern Canada would be projected to become rainfall dominated. These contrasting projections highlight the importance of climate change mitigation, as remaining below the 2 degrees C global warming threshold can avoid large changes over most regions, implying a low likelihood that expensive flood adaptation measures would be necessary.

Both maar lakes are well known for their annually laminated (varved) sediments covering the past 15 000 years. Here, we focus on reconstructing the history of Holocene vegetation, human impact and climate using high-resolution pollen data. Detailed correlation between the two records using palynologically defined tie-points provides for the first time a test of the precision of the individual varve chronologies. The high-resolution pollen records of both Holzmaar and Meerfelder Maar show continuous natural successions of vegetation during the early and mid-Holocene controlled by the development of soil, climate, immigration and competitive expansion of thermophilous tree species. From 6500 varve yr BP onwards, human impact became an increasingly more important factor. Given the high chronological precision of both records, regional similarities, but also local differences of anthropogenically influenced vegetation changes, can be recognized. The reconstructed July temperature between 8500 and 5000 varve yr BP is around 1 degrees C higher than today, most likely in response to higher summer insolation related to orbital forcing. High variability of reconstructed July and January temperatures as well as annual precipitation around 5000 varve yr BP is a prominent climatic signal. This is consistent with other records in several areas of Europe which also identify this period as climatically highly variable.

PFZs were calculated using a multi-linear regression with a suite of geospatial variables from publicly available data and proprietary model results. The statistics suggested that there are two controlling variables that lead to historical failure of the channel embankments: Clear Lake clay soil type and historical willow thicket ecology. The channels are underlain by these two variables in 38.6% of the length of channel, but account for 62.7% of the failures in the study area. Since completion of the study, 60% of the newly reported failures in the study area fall within the boundaries of the defined PFZs and are underlain by Clear Lake clays and historical willow thickets. This approach to identify PFZs is broadly applicable to asset management through identification of maintenance priorities and planning for future likely repairs.																			0895-0563		978-0-7844-8496-8				2023	344						147	155																WOS:001043368200016

The river is a major source of water for industry, municipalities, recreation and power generation and is the link between Lakes Erie and Ontario. The river forms part of the Canada-U.S. border and falls under the jurisdiction of both countries. The massive industrialization of the region surrounding the river has led to a typical resource use conflict situation in which pollution of the river continues to be a major public concern. A number of constitutional, institutional and jurisdictional factors make the management of the Niagara River an involved and complicated matter. The interests, intent, philosophies, laws and regulations are not necessarily the same among the numerous jurisdictions involved. Despite these differences, however, Canada and the United States have succeeded in developing and implementing a model cooperative international management plan for the river. An overview of the main international aspects relating to the development and implementation of this plan, the Niagara River Toxics Management Plan, is presented.																			0167-6369					MAY-JUN	1991	17	2-3					157	166		10.1007/BF00399300	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00399300								24233501					WOS:A1991FZ06800007

Fish Assemblage Structure and Habitat Associations in a Large Western River System	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												Longitudinal gradients of fish assemblage and habitat structure were investigated in the Kootenai River of northern Idaho. A total of 43500-m river reaches was sampled repeatedly with several techniques (boat-mounted electrofishing, hoop nets and benthic trawls) in the summers of 2012 and 2013. Differences in habitat and fish assemblage structure were apparent along the longitudinal gradient of the Kootenai River. Habitat characteristics (e.g. depth, substrate composition and water velocity) were related to fish assemblage structure in three different geomorphic river sections. Upper river sections were characterized by native salmonids (e.g. mountain whitefish Prosopium williamsoni), whereas native cyprinids (peamouth Mylocheilus caurinus, northern pikeminnow Ptychocheilus oregonensis) and non-native fishes (pumpkinseed Lepomis gibbosus, yellow perch Perca flavescens) were common in the downstream section. Overall, a general pattern of species addition from upstream to downstream sections was discovered and is likely related to increased habitat complexity and additions of non-native species in downstream sections. Assemblage structure of the upper sections were similar, but were both dissimilar to the lower section of the Kootenai River. Species-specific hurdle regressions indicated the relationships among habitat characteristics and the predicted probability of occurrence and relative abundance varied by species. Understanding fish assemblage structure in relation to habitat could improve conservation efforts of rare fishes and improve management of coldwater river systems.

Iron-Mediated Photochemical Decomposition of Methylmercury in an Arctic Alaskan Lake	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Sunlight-induced decomposition is the principal sink for methylmercury (CH(3)He) in arctic Alaskan lakes and reduces its availability for accumulation in aquatic food webs However, the mechanistic chemistry of this process in natural waters is unknown We examined experimentally the mechanism of photochemical CH(3)Hg(+) decomposition in filter-sterilized epilimnetic waters of Toolik Lake in arctic Alaska (68 degrees 38'N, 149 degrees 36'W), a region illuminated by sunlight almost continuously during the summer. Results from in situ incubation tests indicate that CH(3)Hg(+) is not decomposed principally by either direct photolysis e, no degradation in reagent-grade water) or primary photochemical reactions with dissolved organic material The preeminent role of labile Fe and associated photochemically produced reactive oxygen species is implicated by tests that show 1) additions of Fe(III) to reagent-grade water enhance CH(3)Hg(+) photodecomposition, 2) strong complexation of ambient Fe(III) with desfernoxamine B inhibits the reaction in lake water, and 3) experimental additions of organic molecules that scavenge hydroxyl radicals specifically among reactive oxygen species (dimethylsulfoxide and formic acid) inhibit CH(3)Hg(+) degradation Lake-water dilution and Fe(III) addition experiments indicate that Fe is not the limiting reactant for CH(3)Hg(+) photodecomposition in Took Lake, which is consistent with prior results indicating that photon flux is a major control.

Based on morphometric parameters inferred from satellite images and the calculation of the drift potential (DP), we examined general characteristics of lunette dunes in the Tirari Desert, South Australia, along with their morphometry and formation processes to determine how this landform type initially formed and its relationship to surrounding linear dune distribution. Results show that the morphometric parameters of lunette dunes and connective lake systems exhibit moderate correlations. It suggests that the morphology of these dunes is controlled by the lakes. Spatially, the lunette dunes present regular arrangement, and the strike of their alignment are approximately in accordance with the linear dunes. The calculated DP implies that the lunette dunes developed under a lowwind-energy environment, which is a wind regime similar to that required for the formation of the surrounding linear dunes. Even though, the resultant DP demonstrates that the summer wind should be responsible for the growth of the lunette dunes. However, accompanied with the repeated drying of lakes and even its disappearance during the dune development process, it not only contributes to the development of lunette dunes but also promotes their transformation to linear dunes.																			2391-5447					JAN	2018	10	1					452	460		10.1515/geo-2018-0035	http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/geo-2018-0035													WOS:000445390700003

These were dimethylsulphide (DMS), dimethyldisulphide (DM2S), dimethyltrisulphide (DM3S), dimethyltetrasulphide (DM4S) and phenol. The concentration of these compounds increased with lake depth. The concentration of DMS and DM2S was higher in the sediment than in the water column. Carbon disulphide occurred only in the sediment. DMS was the only volatile organic compound detected in the epilimnion of the lake, where its concentration increased from winter onwards. The source of DMS was not dimethylsulphoniopropionate (DMSP). This was determined by hydroxylation of the sample with NaOH. There was no change in the concentration of DMS but the concentration of DM2S increased dramatically while the concentrations of DM3S and DM4S decreased concomitantly. This has important implications in the estimation of DMS derived from DMSP by hydroxylation when organic polysulphides are also present. The stability of the hypolimnion of Organic Lake was reflected by the lack of change in temperature, density, redox potential and the relatively constant concentration of volatile organic compounds throughout the year. Potential sources of the volatile organic compounds are discussed in relation to the isolated nature of the lake.																			0954-1020					DEC	1993	5	4					361	366		10.1017/S0954102093000483	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0954102093000483													WOS:A1993ML08300005

Soil Properties under Nitrogen-vs. Phosphorus-Based Manure and Compost Management of Corn	SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL												Concerns about P enrichment of soil, streams, and lakes, NH3 emissions from surface-applied manure, and increasing N fertilizer costs have resulted in greater adoption of manure incorporation at rates that approximate P removal. A 5-yr field study was conducted comparing the influence of annual spring applications of N-vs. P-removal-based compost (74 and 46 Mg ha(-1) wet basis, respectively), liquid dairy manure (196 and 68 kL ha(-1), respectively), and sidedress N fertilizer (0 and 112 kg ha(-1)) on soil pH, soil organic matter (SOM), respiration, NO3-N, and soil test P (STP) and K (STK) in a corn (Zea mays L.) silage cropping system on a calcareous central New York soil. Manure was incorporated with tillage in the P-removal-based system. After 5 yr, soil pH (0-20 cm) remained unchanged compared with its initial level in 2001 regardless of the application rate or source. In P-based manure and inorganic N plots, SOM declined with time but increased by 4 g kg(-1) with N-based compost. Solvita CO2 respiration increased only for N-based compost (41 g mg(-1)), which was greater than for P-based manure (32 g mg(-1)) in April 2005. After 5 yr, topsoil (0-20 cm) STP and STK were greatest with N-based compost and manure. These results show the benefits of compost application for SOM accumulation and respiration, the benefits of P-based applications for management of STP and STK, and the negative impact on SOM because of tillage incorporation of manure at P-based rates. Manure injection rather than tillage-based incorporation might counteract this negative impact.																			0361-5995	1435-0661				SEP-OCT	2016	80	5					1272	1282		10.2136/sssaj2016.03.0086	http://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj2016.03.0086													WOS:000386463900015

Leaf litter breakdown by shredders in the field is affected by leaf toughness, nutritional value and the presence of secondary compounds such as polyphenols. However, experiments involving the use of single fungal strains have not supported the assumption that leaf parameters determine food selection by shredders perhaps because of a failure to test for high consumption prior to isolation of fungal strains, overrepresentation of hyphomycetes or the potential effects of accompanying bacteria. In this study, we used bacteria-free, actively growing fungi and oomycetes isolated from conditioned leaf litter for which a shredder had already shown high consumption rates. 2. Black alder (Alnus glutinosa) leaf litter was exposed to the littoral zone of Lake Constance in autumn, and subsamples were analysed for leaf parameters and consumption by Gammarus roeselii under standard conditions at regular intervals. On dates with a high consumption rate of the exposed leaves, 14 single strains of fungi and oomycetes were isolated, freed of bacteria and grown on autoclaved leaves. 3. Six of eight measured leaf parameters of exposed leaves were significantly correlated with Gammarus consumption rates, with high colinearity among leaf parameters hampering the identification of causal relations between leaf parameters and feeding activity. 4. When single strains of fungi and oomycetes were grown on autoclaved leaf litter, toughness of colonised leaves was always lower than in the control and the content of protein, N and P were increased. There were pronounced strain-specific effects on leaf parameters. Consumption rates also differed significantly, with nine of fourteen isolates consumed at higher rates than controls and none proving to be a deterrent. Protein and polyphenol content were significantly correlated with consumption rates. Oomycete-colonised leaves were consumed at similar rates but were of lower food quality than fungi-colonised leaves. 5. We argue that direct strain-specific attractant or repellent effects of fungi and oomycetes on consumption by G. roeselii are not important. However, we found indirect strain-specific role operating via effects on leaf parameters.

Both periods started after refilling of the reservoir and differed in the amount of introduced predatory fish. Not stocked planktivorous fish increased very intensively their populations in both periods, due to immigration with tributary waters and spawning in the reservoir. They have escaped the pressure of predatory fish. In spite of differences in the amount of introduced predators, total biomass of fish and ratio of predators to planktivores in the end of both periods were similar. Rising pressure of planktivorous fish caused changes in taxonomical composition and numbers of Cladocera, which were similar in both periods. Marked improvement of water quality was found only in the first year of both periods, when a small fish stock was present in the reservoir. Water transparency decreased in the second year and it was very low during the summer of the next years. This indicate as well the importance of natural colonization and succession of fish, as the necessity of more intensive stocking with predators in such lowland, eutrophic dam reservoirs.

Here we present a high-resolution (4-10years) 700-year long mean July air temperature reconstruction based on subfossil chironomid assemblages from a remote lake in the Austrian Eastern Alps to gain further insights into the LIA climatic deterioration in the region. The record provides evidence for a prolonged period of predominantly cooler conditions during AD 1530-1920, broadly equivalent to the climatically defined LIA in Europe. The main LIA phase appears to have consisted of two cold time intervals divided by slightly warmer episodes in the second half of the 1600s. The most severe cooling occurred during the eighteenth century. The LIA temperature minimum about 1.5 degrees C below the long-term mean recorded in the mid-1780s coincides with the strongest volcanic signal found in the Greenland ice cores over the past 700years and may be, at least in part, a manifestation of cooling that followed the long-lasting AD 1783-1784 Laki eruption. A continuous warming trend is evident since ca AD 1890 (1.1 degrees C in 120years). The chironomid-inferred temperatures show a clear correlation with the instrumental data and reveal a close agreement with paleotemperature evidence from regional high-elevation tree-ring chronologies. A considerable amount of the variability in the temperature record may be linked to changes in the North Atlantic Oscillation.

The ''Florunner'' cultivar was grown on Lake fine sand. Water regimes included irrigation with 2.5 cm water whenever water tension at the 30 cm soil depth reached 150-200 mbar; drought imposed for 21 days during early to mid pegging; no-tilled control receiving natural precipitation; and tilled control receiving natural precipitation. Gypsum levels were zero and 1000 kg/ha. All treatments were harvested at 138 days. Irrigation, supplying 10 cm of water in addition to the 70 cm of natural precipitation, did not improve yields. But drought reduced kernel yield from 34 to 28 q[quintals]/ha. A nonsignificant reduction in pod yield accounted for 70% of the reduction in kernel yield under drought. Drought reduced the percentage of sound mature kernels and the shelling percentage, indicating that fruits were less mature when harvested, due to a delay in fruit setting until after the drought was relieved. No-till reduced yields of tops pods and kernels and reduced average seed weight and shelling percentage. Detrimental effects of no-till were due to poor seed bed preparation and severe competition from grasses during late season. Gypsum had no significant effect on yield or quality of peanuts, but it reduced the concentrations of Na and Mg in the upper 15 cm of soil and K in the 15-30 cm depth. Gypsum also reduced soil pH from 5.7 to 5.5 at the 15-30 cm depth. There was a tendency for plant tops to contain less K and Mg in the gypsum treatment than in controls.																			0096-4522						1976	35						56	59																WOS:A1976DF74900016
J	Cutter, SL; Emrich, CT; Gall, M; Reeves, R				Cutter, Susan L.; Emrich, Christopher T.; Gall, Melanie; Reeves, Rachel			Flash Flood Risk and the Paradox of Urban Development	NATURAL HAZARDS REVIEW												This paper traces the historic development of flood risk and the antecedent conditions that contributed to the catastrophic consequences in central South Carolina as the result of the 2015 flash flood. The study draws on archival and contextual research to underscore development paradoxes: the safe development paradoxfederal policies aimed at making hazardous areas safer that have resulted in just the oppositeand the local government paradoxlocal governments permitting development of hazardous areas through lax land-use regulations and zoning while their residents bear the burden of hazards events. These paradoxes are used to illustrate the rapid development of an urban watershed and associated increase in flood risk. A chronology of development patterns from the 1930s with the expansion of the central core urbanized footprint of Columbia shows an increasing level of flood risk exposure as creeks were channelized, ornamental lakes developed, and high-end housing built, all with local government approval. In contrast, the uptake of National Flood Insurance policies remained below national averages for the level of risk in the region especially in the urbanized areas. Unabated hazard exposure and lack of mitigation set the stage for the significant losses incurred in the 2015 flood event and the uneven spatial variability in impacts. Unlike the impacts of Hurricane Katrina or the 2016 Louisiana flash floods, the burden of flood losses fell mostly on residents who could afford to bear the loss. With the exception of the discussion about buy-outs, this catastrophic flash flood event did not lead to a review of or change in land use, building, or zoning ordinances. Instead, the relatively quick residential recovery allowed the community to return to its predisaster state with seemingly few lessons learned. (C) 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.

A one-year field study was carried out in a shallow eutrophic Lake Wuliangsuhai, Inner Mongolia (draining waters from one of the largest irrigation areas in China), to estimate diffusive GHG fluxes and their relative importance in global warming potential (GWP). Our results showed high spatiotemporal variation in dissolved CO2, CH4 and N2O concentrations, while they did not differ significantly between the bottom and surface layers of the shallow waterbody. In general, GHG concentrations and diffusive fluxes were higher in the north part of the lake than in the south. GHG concentrations in the water under the ice were significantly higher than those during the open-water period. Spatial variability of GHG concentrations varied with the bathymetry of the lake. The location of study sites relative to the main inflow and abundance of submerged macrophytes were the main controlling factors of GHG concentrations, as indicated by the consistency of GHG concentrations at the sampling sites, particularly for N2O. The total diffusive GHG emission from Lake Wuliangsuhai was 76.9 +/- 5.4 Gg CO2 equivalents yr(-1), with CO2, CH4 and N2O contributing 16 %, 83 %, and 1 %, respectively. Overall, the results suggest that shallow lakes in mid-latitude arid areas with cold winters can be potentially important GHG sources. However, those lakes are insufficiently represented in the scientific literature, and therefore they deserve more research attention.

Robust chronology is crucial to utilize this archive for paleoenvironmental reconstruction and interpretation. In this study, we reported a robust chronology for the highest wave-built beach ridge around Jinchang paleolake at the northeast (NE) margin of the Tibetan Plateau, using a combined quartz and K-feldspar luminescence dating technique, together with radiocarbon dating. The consistent quartz and K-feldspar ages suggested the sufficient reset of luminescence signals before deposition for the investigated sediments. Both kinds of luminescence ages were in agreement with three independent C-14 ages, further corroborating the robustness of these obtained luminescence ages. Our results demonstrated that the investigated beach ridge was formed around 8.5-6.9 ka, suggesting a distinct period of lake highstand which has been identified in other lakes nearby. This highstand event may implicate an increased regional moisture condition, which is likely caused by the increased Asian summer monsoon precipitation.

Extremely high aerosol loading over Arabian Sea during June 2008: The specific role of the atmospheric dynamics and Sistan dust storms	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												This study focuses on analyzing the extreme aerosol loading and the mechanisms, source areas and meteorological conditions that favored the abnormal dust exposure towards Arabian Sea during June 2008. The analysis reveals that the spatial-averaged aerosol optical depth (ADD) over Arabian Sea in June 2008 is 0.5 (78.2%) higher than the 2000-2013 mean June value and is mostly attributed to the enhanced dust activity and several (18) dust storms originated from the Sistan region (Iran Afghanistan borders). Landsat images show that the marshy lakes in Sistan basin got dried during the second half of June 2008 and the alluvial silt and saline material got easily eroded by the intense Levar winds, which were stronger (>15-20 m s(-1)) than the climatological mean for the month of June. These conditions led to enhanced dust exposure from Sistan that strongly affected the northern and central parts of the Arabian Sea, as forward air-mass trajectories show. The NCEP/NCAR reanalysis reveals an abnormal intensification and spatial expansion of the Indian low pressure system towards northern Arabian Sea in June 2008. This suggests strengthening of the convection over the arid southwest Asia and exposure of significant amount of dust, which can reach further south over Arabian Sea favored by the enhanced cyclonic circulation. MODIS imagery highlighted several dust storms originated from Sistan and affecting Arabian Sea during June 2008, while the SPRINTARS model simulations of increased AOD and dust concentration over Sistan and downwind areas are in agreement with ground-based and satellite observations.

Located at the outlet of Ma'adim Vallis and 250 km south of the volcano Apollinaris Patera, Gusev is an outstanding site to achieve the goals of the MER mission. The crater could have collected sediments from a variety of sources during its 3.9 Ga history, including fluvial, lacustrine, volcanic, glacial, impact, regional and local aeolian, and global air falls. It is a unique site to investigate the past history of water on Mars, climate and geological changes, and the potential habitability of the planet, which are central science objectives of the MER mission. Because of its complex history and potential diversity, Gusev will allow the testing of a large spectrum of hypotheses with the complete suite of MER instruments. Evidence consistent with long-lived lake episodes exist in the landing ellipse area. They might offer a unique opportunity to study, for the first time, Martian aqueous sediments and minerals formed in situ in their geological context. We review the geological history and diversity of the landing site, the science hypotheses that can be tested during the MER mission, and the relevance of Gusev to the MER mission objectives and payload.					; Fike, David/D-3634-2011; Farmer, Jack/B-9343-2019	Urquhart, Mary/0000-0002-9863-9296; Fike, David/0000-0003-2848-0328; 													2169-9097	2169-9100				DEC 30	2003	108	E12							8076	10.1029/2002JE002026	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2002JE002026													WOS:000187898300001

While high VPR values indicate a high rate of prokaryotes' cell lysis, low values are interpreted as a decrease in or absence of viral activity. Salar de Huasco is a high-altitude wetland characterized by a rich microbial diversity associated with aquatic sites like springs, ponds, streams and a lagoon with variable physicochemical conditions. Samples from two ponds, Poza Rosada (PR) and Poza Verde (PV), were analyzed by epifluorescence microscopy to determine variability of viral and prokaryotic abundance and to calculate the VPR in a dry season. In addition, to put Salar de Huasco results into perspective, a compilation of research articles on viral and prokaryotic abundance, VPR, and metadata from various Southern hemisphere ecosystems was revised. The ecosystems were grouped into six categories: high-altitude wetlands, Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, and Southern Oceans and Antarctic lakes. Salar de Huasco ponds recorded similar VPR values (an average of 7.4 and 1.7 at PR and PV, respectively), ranging from 3.22 to 15.99 in PR. The VPR variability was associated with VA and chlorophyll a, when considering all data available for this ecosystem. In general, high-altitude wetlands recorded the highest VPR average (53.22 +/- 95.09), followed by the Oceans, Southern (21.91 +/- 25.72), Atlantic (19.57 +/- 15.77) and Indian (13.43 +/- 16.12), then Antarctic lakes (11.37 +/- 15.82) and the Pacific Ocean (6.34 +/- 3.79). Physicochemical variables, i.e., temperature, conductivity, nutrients (nitrate, ammonium, and phosphate) and chlorophyll a as a biological variable, were found to drive the VPR in the ecosystems analyzed. Thus, the viral activity in the Wetland followed similar trends of previous reports based on larger sets of metadata analyses. In total, this study highlights the importance of including viruses as a biological variable to study microbial temporal dynamics in wetlands considering their crucial role in the carbon budgets of these understudied ecosystems in the southern hemisphere.

J	Brown, DJ; Bell, BR				Brown, David J.; Bell, Brian R.			The emplacement of a large, chemically zoned, rheomorphic, lava-like ignimbrite: the Sgurr of Eigg Pitchstone, NW Scotland	JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY												The Sgurr of Eigg Pitchstone on the Isle of Eigg, NW Scotland, is a crystal-rich, trachydacitic, partially vitrophyric rock, which has previously been interpreted both as a lava and as a sill. We interpret this rock as a chemically zoned, rheomorphic, lava-like ignimbrite that formed during a sustained pyroclastic eruption. The Sgurr of Eigg Pitchstone can be subdivided into discrete emplacement units distinguished by the following features: (1) their present-day weathering characteristics; (2) the orientation, spacing and morphology of the columnar joints; (3) sharp, undulating boundaries with marked topographic breaks. The absence of weathered surfaces, palaeosols, pyroclastic fall deposits or sedimentary rocks at emplacement unit boundaries suggests deposition from a single eruption. The emplacement units, some of which display upper and basal vitrophyres, represent distinct depositional packages that record several rapidly emplaced ignimbrites, which welded, cooled and devitrified as a simple, essentially single, cooling unit, during eruption from a sustained, low pyroclastic column. The Sgurr of Eigg Pitchstone displays a pervasive base-parallel flow banding, which is folded into intrafolial recumbent isoclinal folds. The flow banding and folds indicate that rheomorphism occurred throughout deposition. The Sgurr of Eigg Pitchstone is interpreted as an erosional remnant of an extensive ignimbrite sheet, the first such unit recorded within the North Atlantic Igneous Province.

J	Woodland, WA; Charman, DJ; Sims, PC				Woodland, WA; Charman, DJ; Sims, PC			Quantitative estimates of water tables and soil moisture in Holocene peatlands from testate amoebae	HOLOCENE												Changes in surface wetness on Holocene ombrotrophic mires have principally been estimated from plant macrofossils and humification. Testate amoebae (Protozoa: Rhizopoda) provide an additional technique and have the potential to provide improved quantitative estimates of water-table depths and soil moisture. The relationship between hydrology and testate amoebae assemblages from 163 samples on nine British mires is explored using canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). Mean annual water-table depth and percentage soil moisture are two of the most important environmental variables related to the distribution of testate amoebae within pear. Transfer functions for these variables are developed using four underlying models; weighted averaging (WA), tolerance downweighted weighted averaging (WA-Tol), weighted averaging partial least squares (WA-PLS) and partial least squares (PLS). In 'jack-knifed' validation, WA produced the lowest prediction errors for water table, but was outperformed by WA-Tor for percentage moisture. WA and WA-Tol based transfer functions are then applied to a fossil data set from Bolton Fell Moss, Cumbria. This methodology offers a new technique for reconstructing surface wetness changes on British ombrotrophic and oligotrophic mires and provides data in terms of a meaningful environmental parameter. The cosmopolitan distribution of testate amoebae species suggests that the technique has a much wider geographical potential.

Littoral substrates were mapped by aerial photography and confirmed by ground-truthing. Water depths were determined by echosounding linked to a differential GPS. These data were imported into ArcInfo where a 3D GIS model was used to calculate the total area of smelt, Retropinna retropinna Richardson, spawning habitat (i.e. clean sand between depths of 0.5-2.5 m) at each of five lake levels. There was little change in area over the first 50 cm below the natural maximum lake level, but spawning habitat decreased rapidly over the next 1.4 m such that a 30% reduction occurred at the natural minimum level. Anecdotal information on inter-annual variations in lake level and smelt abundance supported the notion that high lake levels in spring result in high recruitment of smelt. The GIS model also predicted effects of lake level change on areas of macrophyte cover and on other littoral substrates, and could be used to assess effects of lake level changes on the habitats of other biota.																			0969-997X					AUG	2002	9	4					205	216		10.1046/j.1365-2400.2002.00298.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2400.2002.00298.x													WOS:000177149600003
J	Chen, J; Duan, Z				Chen, Jun; Duan, Zheng			Monitoring Spatial-Temporal Variations of Lake Level in Western China Using ICESat-1 and CryoSat-2 Satellite Altimetry	REMOTE SENSING												The lakes in the arid or semi-arid regions of western China are more sensitive to climate changes, and lake levels are considered as a direct indicator of regional climate variability. In this study, we combined satellite altimetry data from ICESat-1 with a smaller footprint and higher accuracy (compared to radar altimetry) and CryoSat-2 with a higher resolution in the along-track direction to monitor lake levels in western China and their trends over a long time period from 2003 to 2021. Our satellite altimetry derived lake levels were well-validated by comparing them against in situ measurements for a lake and independent altimetry-derived product from the DAHITI database for the common lakes. Furthermore, the commonly used linear model was applied to our derived lake level time-series to estimate the overall change trends in 67 typical lake levels over western China. Our results showed that 55 (82%) of these lakes displayed an increasing tendency in water levels, and the remaining 12 (18%) lakes showed a decreasing trend. Overall, the mean water level changing rate in western China was +0.15 m/yr (-1.40 to +0.58 m/yr) during the studied time period. The spatial patterns of the lake level variations can be grouped into three subregions: lake level changes between 2003 and 2021 showed general rising lake levels for the central-northern TP (Tibetan Plateau) endorheic region and Xinjiang, but declining levels for the southern TP exorheic region. The seasonal characteristic of lake level changes showed a significant increase during the summer monsoon season, followed by decreases during the non-monsoon season. The precipitation variations play a leading role in the lake level changes in the context of warm and humid climate states. There were good correspondences between the monthly variations in the lake level and monthly mean precipitation. Additionally, the lake levels also showed a relationship with the air temperature change, in particular, the lake level increase showed a small degree of hysteresis behavior compared with the rising temperatures. Geographically, the precipitation increase in the westerlies regions led to widespread lake expansion in the central-northern TP and Xinjiang. Conversely, precipitation decrease in the Indian monsoon regions caused lake shrinkage in the exorheic region of the southern TP. This study helps us achieve a better understanding of the spatial-temporal patterns of lake level changes in the arid or semi-arid region of western China.					duan, zheng/D-6409-2011	Duan, Zheng/0000-0002-4411-8196														2072-4292				NOV	2022	14	22							5709	10.3390/rs14225709	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs14225709													WOS:000887840600001

Water bodies with commercial rainbow trout production were found to be polluted mainly by nutrients and fish metabolic products that activate eutrophication processes. The functioning of a trout farm was shown to affect the fish population structure of the lake. Fish with spring spawning are preferred. Roach, perch and ruff now predominate in the fish farm area. Fish aggregates in the lake differ considerably in biomass from those in open lake zones. Fish density indices near the fish pond lines were observed to increase almost twofold. Local fish species aggregate near the fish ponds because they eat trout food. The linear and weight growth rates of roach, perch and ruff near the fish ponds were shown to be much higher than those in the remote zones of the lake, because the above fish also eat the leftovers of trout food washed out of the fish ponds. Commercial trout production requires integrated monitoring for assessment of the current condition of the water bodies affected by fish farming.																			1757-8981						2020	941								012014	10.1088/1757-899X/941/1/012014	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1757-899X/941/1/012014													WOS:000664291000014

Joseon Dynasty's Korean Palace Garden is well known for Korean traditional garden, especially as aesthetic beauty. However in this study, it will deal with scientific water circulation system. A stream of water creates a spring. As water flows through residential space, it circulates the complex process of water-treatment, and then, returns to fill the pond up with it. This is how it works practically even though it cannot be seen outside. Therefore, by postulating the symbolic meaning of water, it becomes not only just elevating humanistic value from it but also treating it as multi-purpose well. It is totally different from Western tradition which utilizes their power to operate the fountain as well as Chinese one which built a large lake to store in. Finally, it's expected that this study proposes the possibility to resolve the critical issues which people face in abusing the water usage in contemporary landscape practices.																					978-1-907801-10-5				2010							303	306																WOS:000290497400067

Cyanobacterial bloom phenology in Saginaw Bay from MODIS and a comparative look with western Lake Erie	HARMFUL ALGAE												Saginaw Bay and western Lake Erie basin (WLEB) are eutrophic catchments in the Laurentian Great Lakes that experience annual, summer-time cyanobacterial blooms. Both basins share many features including similar size, shallow depths, and equivalent-sized watersheds. They are geographically close and both basins derive a preponderance of their nutrient supply from a single river. Despite these similarities, the bloom phenology in each basin is quite different. The blooms in Saginaw Bay occur at the same time and place and at the same moderate severity level each year. The WLEB, in contrast, exhibits far greater interannual variability in the timing, location, and severity of the bloom than Saginaw Bay, consistent with greater and more variable phosphorus inputs. Saginaw Bay has bloom biomass that corresponds to relatively mild blooms in WLEB, and also has equivalent phosphorus loads. This result suggests that if inputs of P into the WLEB were reduced to similarly sized loads as Saginaw Bay the most severe blooms would be abated. Above 500 t P input, which occur in WLEB, blooms increase non-linearly indicating any reduction in P-input at the highest inputs levels currently occurring in the WLEB, would yield disproportionately large reductions in cyanobacterial bloom intensity. As the maximum phosphorus loads in Saginaw Bay lie just below this inflection point, shifts in the Saginaw Bay watershed toward greater agriculture uses and less wetlands may substantially increase the risk of more intense cyanobacterial blooms than presently occur.					; Litaker, Richard/AAH-2036-2021; Hood, Raleigh/AGW-0453-2022; Stumpf, Richard/L-5237-2019	Stumpf, Richard/0000-0001-5531-6860; Wynne, Timothy/0000-0001-7282-0866; 													1568-9883	1878-1470				MAR	2021	103								101999	10.1016/j.hal.2021.101999	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.hal.2021.101999		FEB 2021						33980439					WOS:000663075500006

A generic framework for forecasting lake surface area dynamics using level set segmentation and double exponential smoothing	SUSTAINABLE WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT												Water has been a crucial element for the sustenance of civilization throughout history and civilizations have sprung up around a body of water in one form or another. It becomes imperative to address the pressing issue of water shortage and the shrinking size of urban water bodies, which is particularly relevant in Indian cities like Bangalore. The effective management and preservation of these invaluable resources depend on the development of accurate and automated tools to monitor them. The proposed framework introduces a novel approach, combining a level set-based segmentation algorithm with double exponential smoothing to monitor water bodies using multispectral satellite images. In-depth review of nine lakes within Bangalore was carried out using a Landsat time series data set spanning 1987 to 2020. The resulting forecasting model, employing a univariate smoothing methodology, showcased exceptional performance metrics. Notably, it yielded an average error of 0.072 and exhibited a robust correlation coefficient of 0.94 when cross-referenced with proven results. The proposed framework holds great potential for practical implementation in the domain of long-term water body analysis, effectively catering to the requirements of administrative and decision-making entities. Moreover, the adaptability of this framework for the incorporation of additional external factors, as well as its potential to analyze seasonal dynamics, offers exciting avenues for further exploration. The dataset of delineated lake images prepared in this study presents an opportunity for the advancement of image-to-image regression networks, enabling the prediction of both area and shape variations for lakes, thereby enhancing predictive accuracy and insights.

The objective of this work was to determine the concentration and dispersion of HMs in surface water and ground water in a hydrological sub-basin located in southwest Mexico. The samples were collected as following: 24 samples from streams, rivers, and one lake, and 15 samples from springs, located along the Taxco-Cocula sub-basin. A total of 78 samples were collected in the dry and rainy seasons. Physicochemical parameters, major ions, and HMs were analyzed. The pH, Eh, electrical conductivity, and total dissolved solids were analyzed in situ, while the concentrations of anions, cations, and HMs were measured in the laboratory. The results were treated with multivariate analysis and PHREEQC simulation. The highest recorded values (in mg/L) were in surface water, where the HMs in the dry season were Al (28.63), As (0.60), Cd (1.78), Cu (1.10), Fe (68.27), Mn (21.47), Pb (0.02), and Zn (208.80). These high concentrations exceed the limits established by national and international regulations for drinking water. The ground water did not indicate pollutants associated to the mining industry. On the other hand, in the rainy season, the surface water showed a decrease in the concentrations of the measured heavy metals. The hypsometric gradient and the hydrogeological and meteorological characteristics of the Taxco-Cocula sub-basin are the factors that contribute to the dilution and dispersion of the HMs along the 60 km of its length.

J	Ali, A; Gu, WD; Lobinski, RJ				Ali, A; Gu, WD; Lobinski, RJ			Spatial distribution of chironomid larvae (Diptera: Chironomidae) in two central Florida lakes	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY												Spatial distribution of larval Chironomidae was investigated in 2 lakes, Jessup and Monroe, in central Florida. Each lake was divided into 6 sections and benthic samples were seasonally collected from each section from October 1995 to February 1997. Among >30 species of chironomids collected, Glyptotendipes paripes (Edward) was predominant in Lake Jessup. In Lake Monroe, G. paripes and Tanypodinae were codominant, with Chironomus crassicaudatus Malloch being abundant only in the summer. Spatial distribution of dominant chironomid species was analyzed by fitting to the negative binomial distribution, Iwao's patchiness regression, and Taylor's power law. The negative binomial gave variable fits with the chi-square test and with the second moment statistic: Four out of 6 data sets of G. paripes in Lake Monroe fitted the negative binomial distribution based on a chi-square test, whereas in Lake Jessup no data set fitted to this analysis, In contrast, using the second moment statistic, more data sets (4 out of 6) in Lake Jessup fitted to the negative binomial than in Lake Monroe (1 out of 6). Fitness of the negative binomial was good for Tanypodinae in Lake Monroe. The Iwao's regression statistically fitted 8 out of 12 data sets of G. paripes; however, the wide range of beta values (3.12-15.96) suggested this method to be inappropriate for our data. All data sets of G. paripes statistically fitted Taylor's power law with aggregation index,, ranging from 1.498 to 2.162. Homogeneity of Taylor's regression for G, paripes over sampling seasons was revealed in both lakes. Overall, Taylor's power law was a better descriptor for aggregated populations of chironomid larvae in these 2 lakes and provided a basis for developing sequential sampling plans.

The temporal and spatial variations in dissolved organic matter (DOM), chromophoric DOM (CDOM), nitrogen, phosphorus and phytoplankton biomass were investigated from June to September in 2012 and were integrated by principal component analysis (PCA). Three PCA factors were identified: (1) phytoplankton related factor 1, (2) total DOM related factor 2, and (3) eutrophication related factor 3. Factor 1 was a lake-type parameter which correlated with chlorophyll-a and protein-like CDOM (r = 0.793 and r = 0.831, respectively). Factor 2 was a river-type parameter which correlated with total DOC and humic-like CDOM (r = 0.668 and r = 0.726, respectively). Factor 3 correlated with total nitrogen and phosphorus (r = 0.864 and r = 0.621, respectively). The low flow speed, self-sedimentation and nutrient accumulation in QR resulted in increases in PCA factor 1 scores (phytoplankton biomass and derived CDOM) in the spatial scale, indicating a change of river-type water (YR) to lake-type water (QR). In summer, the water temperature variation induced a growth-bloom-decay process of phytoplankton combined with the increase of PCA factor 2 (humic-like CDOM) in the QR, which was absent in the YR.

Discontinuous records of thaw at Barrow from wet tundra sites date back to the 1960s. Comparisons between the longer records with the BE observations reveal strong similarities. Records of permafrost temperature, reflecting changes in the annual surface energy exchange, are available from the 1950s for comparison with results from measurement programs begun in 2002. The long-term systematic geocryological investigations at Barrow indicate an increase in permafrost temperature, especially during the last several years. The increase in near-surface permafrost temperature is most pronounced in winter. Marked trends are not apparent in the active-layer record, although subsidence measurements on the North Slope indicate that penetration into the ice-rich layer at the top of permafrost has occurred over the past decade. Active-layer thickness values from the 1960s are generally higher than those from the 1990s, and are very similar to those of the 2000s. Analysis of spatial active-layer observations at representative locations demonstrates significant variations in active-layer thickness between different landscape types, reflecting the influence of vegetation, substrate, microtopography, and, especially, soil moisture. Landscape-specific differences exist in the response of active-layer thickness to climatic forcing. These differences are attributable to the existence of localized controls related to combinations of surface and subsurface characteristics. The geocryological records at Barrow illustrate the importance and effectiveness of sustained, well organized monitoring efforts to document long-term trends.					; Streletskiy, Dmitry/C-3333-2017	Shiklomanov, NIkolay/0000-0002-8609-0240; Streletskiy, Dmitry/0000-0003-2563-2664; Hollister, Robert/0000-0002-4764-7691													2169-8953	2169-8961				NOV 17	2010	115								G00I04	10.1029/2009JG001248	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2009JG001248													WOS:000284482200001

This value falls within the optimum range for enhanced oil recovery. A number of strains of halobacteria originally from the National Research Council of Canada and some isolated from the Great Salt Lake, Utah [USA] were studied. Surface activity was measured on whole cells, growth media, and lipid extracts. Strain GSL-11, a Great Salt Lake isolate, showed the greatest lowering of surface tension under most conditions (41.0 mNm-1) GSL-11. This and two other strains were used to extract bitumen from Utah sands using the method of Zajic and Akit (1983). Whole cells in growth medium or lysed cells in distilled water resulted in the Ajic and Akit (1983). Whole cells in growth medium or lysed cells in distilled water resulted in the greatest recovery of oil. GSL 11 gave an improvement factor of 0.73 for release of surface plus emulsified oil against distilled water. The improvement factors were comparable to reports in the literature for other microorganisms. Halobacterial cells and lipids appear to have a potential for enhanced oil recovery.																			0723-2020	1618-0984				NOV	1988	11	1					97	101		10.1016/S0723-2020(88)80055-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0723-2020(88)80055-9													WOS:A1988R402300016

Sand Petrology and Heavy Minerals	JOURNAL OF GEOLOGY												The Zambezi River rises at the center of southern Africa, flows across the low-relief Kalahari Plateau, meets Karoo basalt, plunges into Victoria Falls, follows along Karoo rifts, and pierces through Precambrian basement to eventually deliver its load onto the Mozambican passive margin. Reflecting its polyphase evolution, the river is subdivided into segments with different geological and geomorphological character, a subdivision finally fixed by man's construction of large reservoirs and faithfully testified by sharp changes in sediment composition. Pure quartzose sand recycled from Kalahari desert dunes in the uppermost tract is next progressively enriched in basaltic rock fragments and clinopyroxene. Sediment load is renewed first downstream of Lake Kariba and next downstream of Lake Cahora Bassa, documenting a stepwise decrease in quartz and durable heavy minerals. Composition becomes quartzo-feldspathic in the lower tract, where most sediment is supplied by high-grade basements rejuvenated by the southward propagation of the East African rift. Feldspar abundance in Lower Zambezi sand has no equivalent among big rivers on Earth and far exceeds that in sediments of the northern delta, shelf, and slope, revealing that provenance signals from the upper reaches have ceased to be transmitted across the routing system after closure of the big dams. This high-resolution petrologic study of Zambezi sand allows us to critically reconsider several dogmas, such as the supposed increase of mineralogical "maturity" during long-distance fluvial transport, and forges a key to unlock the rich information stored in sedimentary archives, with the ultimate goal to accurately reconstruct the evolution of this mighty river flowing across changing African landscapes since the late Mesozoic.

Carbonate-rich dendrolitic cones: insights into a modern analog for incipient microbialite formation, Little Hot Creek, Long Valley Caldera, California	NPJ BIOFILMS AND MICROBIOMES												Ancient putative microbial structures that appear in the rock record commonly serve as evidence of early life on Earth, but the details of their formation remain unclear. The study of modern microbial mat structures can help inform the properties of their ancient counterparts, but modern mineralizing mat systems with morphological similarity to ancient structures are rare. Here, we characterize partially lithified microbial mats containing cm-scale dendrolitic coniform structures from a geothermal pool ("Cone Pool") at Little Hot Creek, California, that if fully lithified, would resemble ancient dendrolitic structures known from the rock record. Light and electron microscopy revealed that the cm-scale 'dendrolitic cones' were comprised of intertwined microbial filaments and grains of calcium carbonate. The degree of mineralization (carbonate content) increased with depth in the dendrolitic cones. Sequencing of 16S rRNA gene libraries revealed that the dendrolitic cone tips were enriched in OTUs most closely related to the genera Phormidium, Leptolyngbya, and Leptospira, whereas mats at the base and adjacent to the dendrolitic cones were enriched in Synechococcus. We hypothesize that the consumption of nutrients during autotrophic and heterotrophic growth may promote movement of microbes along diffusive nutrient gradients, and thus microbialite growth. Hour-glass shaped filamentous structures present in the dendrolitic cones may have formed around photosynthetically-produced oxygen bubbles-suggesting that mineralization occurs rapidly and on timescales of the lifetime of a bubble. The dendrolitic-conical structures in Cone Pool constitute a modern analog of incipient microbialite formation by filamentous microbiota that are morphologically distinct from any structure described previously. Thus, we provide a new model system to address how microbial mats may be preserved over geological timescales.

The advertising display of double-crested cormorants varies with microhabitat and time of the season in a tree-nesting colony	ACTA ETHOLOGICA												Male double-crested cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) perform advertising displays at potential nest locations at spring breeding grounds to attract females. Yet, there is no research on how the frequency of this behaviour changes over time or its association with habitat features. Studies of this behavioural display may provide insight into how birds choose areas for nesting, an important issue given the environmental and societal impacts of dense colonies of cormorants. Advertising behaviour was observed in trees throughout the 2014 nesting season, at six different sampling stations, using both scan sampling (for temporal changes in display frequency) and focal sampling (for temporal changes in four microhabitat variables: tree health, height in tree, nest density and presence of a nest). Advertising data (scans N = 484 birds; focal samples N = 827 birds) were divided into pre-incubation, incubation and chicks-present categories using a breeding chronology dataset. The number of cormorants advertising varied temporally and spatially. Using scan data in a marginal model, we found that the number of cormorants advertising was highest at the beginning of the season (peaking at week 3) and lowest once chicks were present. The GLM (focal data) showed that most cormorants advertised without nests especially past the second week of the season. The model also indicated that cormorants advertised in low nest density trees from pre- to mid-incubation. Contrary to our predictions based on colony expansion over the season, we did not observe an interaction of tree health*time or station*time, which suggests that the advertising display revealed a nest site selection process that was not visible at the population level.

Thirteen new county records were added for Nigronia serricornis (Say), and 18 new county records were recorded for N. fasciatus (Walker). Eight new county records were added for Neohermes concolor (Davis), while six new county records were noted for Chauliodes pectinicornis (Linnaeus). Following this investigation, the statewide distribution of fishfly species is as follows: Nigronia serricornis (45 counties), N. fasciatus (37 counties), Neohermes concolor (10 counties), Chauliodes pectinicornis (19 counties), and C. rastricornis (3 counties). Tarter and Watkins (1974), Watkins, et al. (1975), and Dolin and Tarter (1981) have reported distributional records of fishflies for West Virginia. Tarter, et al. (1977) noted seasonal emergence patterns for fishflies in West Virginia. The main objective of this investigation is to report new county records of fishflies for West Virginia. Three eastern genera of fishflies, Chauliodes Latreille, Neohermes Banks, and Nigronia Banks, are placed in the subfamily Chauliodinae. Generally, larvae of lentic species, C. pectinicornis (Linnaeus) and C. rastricornis Rambur, are found in logs near ponds, swamps, lakes, and oxbows, whereas the larvae of lotic species, N. fasciatus (Walker) and N. serricornis (Say), are found under rocks in streams (Tarter, et al., 1976). Larvae of Neohermes concolor (Davis) are found under leaf litter near spring seeps (Tarter, et al., 1979). Larval and adult specimens examined for this investigation are deposited at the following institutions and agencies: West Virginia Benthological Survey (WVBS) at Marshall University, Huntington, WV; West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection (WVDEP), Charleston, WV; and West Virginia Department of Agriculture (WVDA), Charleston, WV.																			0013-872X	2162-3236				NOV-DEC	2013	123	4					278	284		10.3157/021.123.0410	http://dx.doi.org/10.3157/021.123.0410													WOS:000331135700003

Monthly variations of parameters like temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll-a, total phosphorus etc., along the Aitoliko lagoon water column, were recorded and studied at 14 stations. Throughout the sampling period, in lagoon's water column three layers were determined: the surface low density layer (11.49-16.15), the layer with the steep density gradient and the deep dense (19.78-20.62) water below the depth of 20 m. The depth of the surface and pycnocline layers depends on seasonal surface salinity (20.53-22.43%.) and temperature (12.48-28.40 degrees C) alterations. Lagoon's monimolimnion was extended, below the depth of 20 m and had constant temperature and salinity equal to about 13 degrees C and 27%o respectively. Meteorological conditions control temperature (R-2=0.845) and dissolved oxygen (R-2=0.576) monthly changes, in lagoon's epilimnion, while salinity seems to be related with the salt/fresh water budget into Aitoliko lagoon. Epilimnetic chlorophyll-a (3.29-14.89 mu g l(-1)) and total phosphorus (13.33-36.31 mu g(-1)) concentrations classify Aitoliko lagoon as a mesotrophic environment (40<TSI(Chl-a)<55, 40<TSI(TP)<60). The vertical distribution of dissolved oxygen in the water column was always of special interest. During the last decades the Aitoliko lagoon was reported as a permanent anoxic basin. The depth of the anoxic layer gradually decreased and reached 5 m depth during 2003-2004. In the present study, the anoxic layer was limited below the depth of 18 m during summer. The most interesting is the dissolved oxygen presence in lagoon's monimolimnion during January and February, 2007. In this study, for the first time, Aitoliko lagoon was reported as seasonal anoxic basin.

THE FIRST TROPICAL ALIEN CRAYFISH SPECIES IN EUROPEAN WATERS: THE REDCLAW CHERAX QUADRICARINATUS (VON MARTENS, 1868) (DECAPODA, PARASTACIDAE)	CRUSTACEANA												A population of the tropical redclaw crayfish Cherax quadricarinatus (Von Martens, 1868) is reported here for the first time in Europe, despite some occasionally found released individuals found previously in some European countries. The redclaw population was first found in 2009 in the natural river oxbow lake Topla, with thermal hot water springs, in eastern Slovenia (Central Europe). The species is known to be invasive in tropical and subtropical regions, but this is the first record from the temperate climate zone. During intensive sampling with traps, 15 individuals were caught that seemed to belong to a sex- and age-structured population. The low abundance indicated that the population was still in the growth phase of colonization, or that habitat conditions for the species in the oxbow lake were suboptimal. The redclaw individuals were found at temperatures of up to 40 degrees C, but the bulk of the population with sexually mature individuals was restricted to regions between 21 and 31 degrees C. According to the modelled limits of annual water temperature fluctuation, further expansion of the redclaw is expected in the thermal oxbow lake, but invasion to adjacent rivers is less probable at least under current climatic conditions. As a rapidly growing large crayfish, the redclaw could pose a threat to local ecosystems in specific thermal water bodies with unique fauna and flora. Future studies are important to define threats of tropical invaders in specific thermal freshwater ecosystems in Europe.

J	Hiriart-Baer, VP; Smith, REH				Hiriart-Baer, VP; Smith, REH			Models for ultraviolet radiation-dependent photoinhibition of Lake Erie phytoplankton	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We calibrated a model for ultraviolet radiation (UVR) and photosynthetically active radiation-dependent photoinhibition, with explicit damage and recovery processes (the R model), against observations of photosynthesis by Lake Erie phytoplankton exposed to natural sunlight in the summer of 1998. The model explained 74%-96% of the variation in photosynthetic rates and indicated active recovery processes at 4 of the 5 experimental stations. UVR-dependent photoinhibition kinetics were not as well explained by two simpler models that assumed either a lack of recovery processes or an instantaneous equilibrium between damage and recovery. The 1998-calibrated R model also provided consistently significant predictions of photoinhibition in 10 experiments done the previous year, albeit with a reduced goodness-of-fit, whereas simpler models did not. Biological weighting functions (BWFs) derived for UVR effects in 1998 were similar in shape throughout the UVR part of the spectrum, with an especially steep decrease from 300 to 320 nm, compared with BWFs published for other phytoplankton communities and/or species. The R model predicted photoinhibitory losses of primary production, integrated through the photic zone, that were intermediate between the two simpler models and showed that Lake Erie phytoplankton varied in both their spectral sensitivity (as expressed by the BWF) and recovery rates.

Christopher; Young, Roger G.; Depree, Craig, V			Dynamics of phosphorus exchange between sediment and water in a gravel-bed river	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Phosphorus (P) stores in gravel-bed rivers are released for uptake by periphyton when pH levels exceed 8.5. The Tukituki River has low alkalinity water and frequently experiences periphyton blooms, and daytime pH > 9 during summer low-flows. We measured dissolved reactive P (DRP) and EPC0, the water concentration of DRP at which no net release or sorption from the river bed occurs, in sediment samples from the Tukituki River subject to controlled pH levels before (2014) and after (2017) changes to two wastewater discharges that reduced P release to the river by 95%. DRP released from 2014 sediments at pH 8.5-10 were 30 +/- 10 mg/m(3) above background (pH 8) whereas those released from 2017 sediments were 5 +/- 3 mg/m(3) above background. EPC0 levels in 2014 and 2017 were 11 +/- 6 and 7 +/- 2 mg/m(3), respectively. Field estimates of released DRP calculated from continuous pH and the Redfield equation suggested that most of the readily available DRP released from sediments at elevated pH is derived from material attached to recently deposited sediment. Subsequently, a reduction in wastewater inputs or agricultural runoff should reduce sediment DRP stores, and hence sediment fluxes, within a few years and mitigate periphyton blooms in addition to directly lowering water column concentrations.

However, due to cloud contamination, LST is often limited to clear-sky conditions and the differences between clear-sky and all-sky LST will lead to clear-sky biases of LST. Consequently, the accuracy of ET varies drastically under different weather conditions. To evaluate the impact of clear-sky biases on ET estimation, the monthly ET under clear-sky and all-sky conditions was estimated using a nonparametric method at several sites with different humid conditions and vegetation coverage in 2014. 35.7 % of the clear-sky LST values were acquired in the arid region (Heihe River Basin) with different vegetation coverage. As the climate became more humid, only 14.2 % of the clear-sky LST data were available (Poyang Lake Basin). The clear-sky biases of LST variation at the sites resulted in a significant reduction in the accuracy of monthly ET, with an increase in the relative error (RE) of approximately 16.6 %. The impact of clouds can be reduced by at most half by the introduction of all-sky LST products, with a significant decline (6.3 % similar to 34.2 % of ET) in the error contribution of LST to monthly ET. The variation in vegetation coverage of land cover and the change in humidity of the climate significantly affected the influence of the clear-sky biases of LST on the ET estimation and the error contribution to ET. Replacing all-sky LST with clear-sky LST in areas with less vegetation coverage exacerbates the underestimation of ET estimation and strengthens the error contribution of LST with the decline in RE (error contribution of LST) from -7.7 % (-6.3 %) in densely vegetated areas to -29.7 % (-34.2 %) in non-vegetated areas, especially in the summer. Similarly, clear-sky biases of LST tended to have a relatively significant impact on the error contributions of LST to monthly ET estimation when the climate became humid, with a relatively significant enlarging from -6.3 % in the arid area to -10.0 % in the humid area, especially in the rainy season in the humid area (-61.3 % of ET). This study contributes to the understanding of the relationship between clear-sky biases and vegetation coverage/humidity. Quantitative analysis of the impact of clear-sky biases of LST on monthly ET estimation will be helpful for improving the accuracy of ET retrieval in the future.

The individual filaments sink slowly (at 0.4 m day-1) if their gas vacuoles are collapsed by pressure. The red Oscillatoria dominated the plankton and formed a population at a depth of 6 m in Lake Gjersjoen in July 1981. Filaments near the water surface mostly sank while those at 6 m and below were mostly buoyant. Buoyancy changed at all depths during the day, rising at night and falling in the day-time, in response to light intensity. However, the distance moved by the individual filaments (< 0.1 m) was too small to give detectable changes in the position of the population peak. In late July some of the filaments aggregated to form colonies which changed buoyancy in the same way but, being much larger, moved more rapidly than separate filaments: they floated up to the lake surface at night, collecting filaments in their path and sank down during the day.																			0003-9136						1983	97	1					18	38																WOS:A1983QS97600003

Precipitation variations from different records in north-central China, especially in the EASM margin area, are controversial. Here, we present a multi-proxy (grain size, pollen, TOC and TOC/TN ratio) record from Kulun-nuur Lake in east-central Inner Mongolia as an archive of moisture variations over the last millennium. Our record reveals that the Kulun-nuur Lake area is characterized by a wet Medieval Warm Period (MWP; 900-1300 AD), a dry Little Ice Age (LIA; 1300-1820 AD) and a relatively wet Current Warm Period (CWP; 1820 AD to present). In addition, within the context of an overall wet climate during the MWP, a short-term relatively dry episode occurred from 1000 to 1070 AD. The climate patterns reconstructed from Kulun-nuur Lake display good consistency with other records and models, suggesting that warm-wet/cold-dry are the main climate patterns in north-central China during the last millennium. These patterns of regional hydrological changes on multi-decadal to centennial scales may be related to solar activity and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation.

Land use practices or global warming can have a significant effect on the production and survival of brook trout in these streams. Managers must be able to evaluate the potential impact of thermal changes upon these streams and bioenergetics models represent a valuable tool in this effort. Here we present a bioenergetics model for brook trout and conduct a laboratory validation of the model. Model validation experiments showed the model to adequately predict the growth, final weight, and consumption of fish in the experiments. Growth and final weight were estimated within -1.4% (not significantly different than 0) and consumption was slightly underestimated, within -19.7% (+/- 7.5%) of observed values. Scope for growth from the bioenergetics model suggests that given unlimited food, growth of brook trout may be possible over the range of environmental temperatures supporting brook trout. However, under more restricted rations typical of Appalachian headwater streams (20% ad libitum) only modest growth is possible between 3.5 and 20C. These growth restrictions may have serious implications for thermal alterations upon Appalachian brook trout and may suggest that energetically, over winter may be a critical time for these fish.																									2001							38	51																WOS:000184053000005

Assessing the environmental quality status in estuarine and coastal systems: Comparing methodologies and indices	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS					Summer Meeting of the American-Society-of-Limnology-and-Oceanography	JUN 04-09, 2006	Victoria, CANADA	Amer Soc Limnol & Oceanog				Increasingly on a worldwide scale, legislation has been adopted to determine the ecological integrity of surface waters including streams, rivers, lakes, estuaries and coastal waters. An integral part of determining ecological integrity is the measurement of biological integrity, typically emphasizing analyses of plankton, benthos, macroalgae and fish. In the development of protocols for evaluating biological integrity, benthic macroinvertebrate communities are the most consistently emphasized biotic component of aquatic ecosystems. A plethora of methodologies with hundreds of indices, metrics and evaluation tools are presently available. An ecologically parsimonious approach dictates that investigators should place greater emphasis on evaluating the suitability of indices that already exist prior to developing new ones. Hence, the authors organized within the American Society of Limnology and oceanography 2006 Summer Meeting, 4-9 June 2006, in Victoria, BC, Canada, a special session with the objective to compare methodologies, applications and interpretations existing in various countries and attempting to contribute to an improved understanding of the suitability of such approaches when using benthic communities. From the 25 contributions presented in this session, eight manuscripts were selected to be included in this special issue of Ecological Indicators including new index development, novel validation approaches, assessment of spatio-temporal applications, interpretations relative to management needs and potential adaptive management modifications to maximize the robustness, sensitivity, and representativeness of environmental information conveyed to management.

This study intends to find Danau Rayo's uniqueness from the geoscience perspective, especially a morphological approach. The shape of the lake, which looks like a perfect circle with a diameter of about 645 meters in the middle of a plain that is not connected to a river, shows its geological uniqueness. The results of 3-dimensional modeling show that there are elevations on several sides, especially the southeast side, allowing the hypothesis that the lake is a meteor fall that formed a crater. The intensive weathering and erosion processes cause the features of the crater rim characterized by rounded lithology, excellent sorting, open packing, high porosity, and good permeability to convert into a slip plane when a meteor impacts the northwest lake rim, leaving no trace behind. The unique geological feature of this geosite may add its geological value for geotourism development in this area.					; Setiawan, Budhi/AAI-9777-2021	Setiawan, Budhi/0000-0002-1916-2064; , Idarwati/0009-0000-0572-8728; 													1755-1307						2024	1424								012008	10.1088/1755-1315/1424/1/012008	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1755-1315/1424/1/012008													WOS:001414382800008

The present study aimed to investigate the prevalence of Legionella species in water resources of Iran by a systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods: In search of papers relevant to the prevalence of Legionella in water resources of Iran, the scientific information database in both English and Persian languages was used. The search was limited to studies between the year 2000 and end of July 2016. Each cohort and cross-sectional study that reported the contamination of water with Legionella was included in the present study. For data analysis, comprehensive meta-analysis software with Cochran's Q and I-2 tests were used. P values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Results: The prevalence of Legionella species in water resources of Iran was 27.3% (95% CI: 25.3-29.3). The prevalence of Legionella spp. in hospital water, dental settings water, and other water resources were 28.8% (95% CI: 26.4-31.2), 23.6% (95% CI: 16.1-33.2), and 29.6% (95% CI: 25.6-33.8), respectively. The most common Legionella species was L. pneumophila with a prevalence of 60.5% (95% CI: 53.3-67.2) and the prevalence of all other species was 52.5% (95% CI: 44.7-60.2). The highest prevalence was reported in Isfahan with 55.7% (95% CI: 48.0-63.0). Conclusion: Based on the results, the prevalence rate of Legionella species in water resources of Iran was high and the most common Legionella species was L. pneumophila.

Hyperscums of Microcystis aeruginosa formed during prolonged periods of calm weather in wind-protected sites in a hypertrophic lake subject to low wind speeds (Hartbeespoort Dam, South Africa). A hyperscum that extended over 1-2 hectares and persisted for 103 days during winter 1983 was studied. Chlorophyll a concentrations ranged from 100 to 300 mg l-1. Microcystis cell concentrations reached 1.76 .times. 109 cells ml-1 or 116 cm3 l-1. The hyperscum environment was anoxic, aphotic, with a fluctuating temperature regime and low pH values. The densely packed Microcystis cells survived these conditions for more than 2 months. This was shown by comparing the potential photosynthetic capacity of Microcystis from the hyperscum with that of Microcystis from the main basin of the lake. However, after 3 months the hyperscum algae lost their photosynthetic capacity and decomposition processes prevailed. The hyperscum gradually shrank in size until a storm caused its complete disintegration.																			0142-7873	1464-3774					1985	7	3					399	409		10.1093/plankt/7.3.399	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/7.3.399													WOS:A1985AHN9700007

Similar to the native mysid Mysis diluviana. Hemimysis exhibits a diel vertical migration pattern but generally inhabits shallower and warmer waters than M. diluviana. Because basic information on the distribution, habitat use, and biology of Hemimysis in the Great Lakes is scarce, the potential for food web disruption by Hemimysis cannot easily be predicted. Preliminary observations indicate widespread invasion of Hemimysis in Lake Ontario. In this study, we confirm the presence of Hemimysis at sites spanning the northern and southern shores of Lake Ontario and the presence of the individuals during winter months. In one horizontal tow in November 2007, over 26,000 individuals were collected with a length range of 4.4 to 9.0 mm and an average caloric density of 611 cal/g wet weight. The most effective methods for sampling Hemimysis were horizontal tows with either a zooplankton net in the water column or a benthic sled near the lake bottom. Although more quantitative data on the life history and distribution of this species is necessary, our preliminary observations support the prediction that the potential for Hemimysis to impact the nearshore food web in Lake Ontario appears high.

Although production of phytoplankton and bacteria was enchanced by additions of phosphorus, and of phosphorus and humic matter together, the effects on zooplankton were less clear. The modest response of metazooplankton was partly due to the short time of the experiments, but it was also due to loss of carbon through respiration in several steps of the microbial food chain Protozoans had key roles as grazers in the system; heterotrophic nanoflagellates were the most important grazers of bacteria, whereas ciliates were more important algal grazers than metazooplankton. Indirect evidence suggested that ciliates formed a considerable proportion of the food of metazooplankton. The amount of carbon released through respiration exceeded the sum of that fixed by primary producers and lost through sedimentation. If the climate change in the boreal zone increases loading of nutrients and humic matter into lakes, this imbalance between respiration and fixation of carbon can be expected to increase.

However, the existing water color investigations have mostly focused on the lakes with areas greater 1 km(2). In order to improve the understanding of the color of water bodies in China, a cloud-free composite image of China for the summer of 2015 was generated using time-series of Landsat-8 imagery and the best-available-pixel (BAP) compositing algorithm. Then, the first Forel-Ule index (FUI) water color product with a resolution of 30 m was produced for China using the generated BAP composite and the Google Earth Engine computing platform. Finally, the first national-scale assessment of the FUI of natural lakes with an area >0.01 km(2) (N = 60026) was conducted based on the generated FUI product. The generated FUI product was shown to have a high degree of consistency with in situ water surface reflectance-derived FUI (R-2 = 0.90, P < 0.001). Also, it had a high degree of consistency with the in situ Secchi depth (R-2 = 0.90, P < 0.001) and trophic level index (R-2 = 0.62, P < 0.001) datasets. In addition, we found that the most prevalent lake colors in China were yellow (about 49%) and green (about 41%). Besides, the proportion of small lakes (areas < 1 km(2)) found to be yellow was much larger than for large lakes (area >= 1 km(2)) (50% against 28%). Our results will provide important information that can be used for preserving and restoring inland water resources.

Distribution and Composition of Aquatic Macrophytes in Santhapettai Lake of Villupuram District in Tamil Nadu	INTERNATIONAL LETTERS OF NATURAL SCIENCES												Macrophytes are important component of the aquatic ecosystem and broad changes in the abundance of individual species and community composition provide valuable information on how and why an ecosystem might be changing. Santhapettai lake is one of the biggest fresh water lake in Villupuram district, Tamil Nadu. The physico-chemical parameters were analysed for one year (October 2012-September 2013). Quadrates were laid randomly and extending from shoreline towards the lake center. The macrophytes falling in each quadrate were sorted species wise, identified and data were recorded. The plants have been identified from fresh materials with the help of different floras. In this present investigation, a total of 33 species belonging to 23 families and 28 genera were identified under algae, pteridophytes, dicotyledons and monocotyledons. Further, the plants were classified in morphological group as floating (7), submerged (1), submerged anchored (13), floating leaved (1) and emergent anchored (11). The coverage/spread of macrophytes along the shorelines was higher compared to the centre of the lakes where the species composition was found reduced. Assessment of biota, continuous monitoring and conservation lake are the important components to safeguard the biological wealth of lentic and lotic freshwater ecosystem.																			2300-9675						2015	47						74	81																WOS:000365979500008
J	RUGGLES, AK				RUGGLES, AK			HABITAT SELECTION BY LOONS IN SOUTH-CENTRAL ALASKA	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Three species of loons nest in the Matanuska-Susitna Valley, an area 80 km north of Anchorage in southcentral Alaska. This is a region of intense change; its human population doubled between 1980-1990 to almost 36000 people. The Alaska Department of Fish and Game through its Loon Watch Program has monitored 150 to 200 lakes since 1984, half of which are used by loons. Common loons (Gavia immer) nested on lakes of at least 12 ha while Pacific loons (G. pacifica) used lakes as small as 4 ha. Red-throated loons (G. stellata) were found on even smaller ponds. On all waters used by reproductive loons, 89% were connected to other water bodies, 62% of the shore was appropriate for nesting and 85% of the area was < 15 ft (4.6 m) deep. This littoral zone comprised habitat for three-spined stickleback fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus), the dominant food source for loons, and supported large macrophyte beds that were used by loons as chick-rearing areas. The effect of human presence on summer loon distribution was dependent on the willingness of humans to accommodate to the needs of loons.																			0018-8158					APR 1	1994	279						421	430		10.1007/BF00027873	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00027873													WOS:A1994NK39900039

Hof Shahaf, located on the shore of Lake Kinneret in Israel, is a recently excavated Natufian site whose interpretation presents a conundrum. On the one hand, the site produced evidence of architecture, burial, and diverse subsistence practices, just like the rich and permanently occupied hamlets of this culture. On the other hand, it clearly diverged in the meager accumulation of artifacts (lithics and fauna) and an apparent absence of aquatic resource exploitation. Here, we aim to understand the nature of habitation at Hof Shahaf: whether it was a sedentary hamlet, an ephemeral residential camp, or a task-specific logistic locality. The latter two site types are not well documented in the Early Natufian of the Mediterranean climate zone. We provide a zooarchaeological and taphonomic account of the site, supplemented with lithic data, to investigate the paleoenvironment, subsistence, and site-occupation intensity, all against the backdrop of a specific setting (one of the lowest recorded lake stands). Our results indicate that the site primarily falls within a middle ground between classic sedentary hamlets and more specialized sites. It may have functioned as an ephemeral residential camp for foragers traveling to the Kinneret Basin for specific or seasonal tasks. Nevertheless, the site still held some significance, evidenced by the investment in building a large structure and burying the dead.

J	Scully, NM; Leavitt, PR; Carpenter, SR				Scully, NM; Leavitt, PR; Carpenter, SR			Century-long effects of forest harvest on the physical structure and autotrophic community of a small temperate lake	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												The effects of forest clearcut and regrowth on a small (8.1 ha) stained lake were studied using a 200-year record of fossil carotenoids and chlorophylls. Comparison of high-resolution cores recovered from exposed, sheltered, and reference lake basins showed that annual laminations of sediments ceased concomitant with logging (ca. 1870-1890), indicating a fundamental change in the lake mixing regime. Biological responses to forest harvest included elimination of deepwater populations of anaerobic photosynthetic bacteria and reduced abundance of metalimnetic chrysophytes. Photosynthetic bacteria remained absent for over 100 years, while sediment laminae and chrysophytes have only returned since around 1970. In contrast, populations of epilimnetic phytoplankton (cyanobacteria, chlorophytes, cryptophytes) were unaffected by the clearcut. Analysis of sediment profiles did not reveal evidence of eutrophication or of increased flux of organic matter following watershed disturbance. Instead, fossil records were most consistent with increased wind stress, leading to deeper water column mixing in fall and reduction in deepwater anoxia, the main factor promoting sediment laminations and populations of photosynthetic bacteria. Such century-long disturbance may be common in small, stratified boreal lakes that lack physical shelter due to landforms.

The new Scoresby Land Supergroup is now composed of the Wordie Creek, Pingo Dal, Gipsdalen and Fleming Fjord Groups. This paper only deals with the lithostratigraphy of the late Early-Late Triassic continental deposits of the latter three groups with emphasis on the vertebrate-bearing Fleming Fjord Group. The new Pingo Dal Group consists of three new formations, the Rodstaken, Paradigmabjerg and Klitdal Formations (all elevated from members), the new Gipsdalen Group consists of three new formations, the Kolledalen, Solfaldsdal (with the new Graklint Member) and Kap Seaforth Formations (all elevated from members), and the new Fleming Fjord Group is subdivided into three new formations, the Edderfugledal, Malmros Klint and Orsted Dal Formations (all elevated from members). The Edderfugledal Formation contains two cyclic bedded, lacustrine members, a lowermost Sporfjeld Member (elevated from beds), and an uppermost Pingel Dal Member (elevated from beds). The lacustrine red beds of the Malmros Klint Formation are not subdivided. The lacustrine and fluvial Orsted Dal Formation contains three new members. In the eastern and central part of the basin, the formation is initiated by cyclic bedded, red lacustrine mudstones of the Carlsberg Fjord Member (elevated from beds), while in the northwestern part of the basin the lowermost part of the formation is composed of grey fluvial conglomerates and sandstones with subordinate red mudstones of the Bjergkronerne Member (elevated from beds). The uppermost part of the formations in most of the basin is composed of cyclic bedded, variegated lacustrine mudstones and grey to yellowish marlstones of the Tait Bjerg Member (elevated from beds). The sediments in the Fleming Fjord Group contain remains of a rich and diverse vertebrate fauna including dinosaurs, amphibians, turtles, aeotosaurs, pterosaurs, phytosaurs and mammaliaforms. Most vertebrate bones have been found in uppermost Malmros Klint Formation, and in the Carlsberg Fjord and Tait Bjerg Members. The Norian-early Rhaetian, lacustrine Fleming Fjord Group was deposited at about 41 degrees N on the northern part of the supercontinent Pangaea. Lacustrine sedimentation was controlled by seasonal as well as longer-term (orbital) variation in precipitation. Precipitation was probably brought to the basin by southwesterly winds. The lacustrine sediments of the uppermost Fleming Fjord Group show deposition during increasingly humid conditions changing the lake environment from an ephemeral lake-steppe area to a perennial lake. This evolution of lake environment suggests a change from a winter-wet temperate climate to one with precipitation throughout the year.					; Mateus, Octávio/F-2910-2010; Mateus, Octavio/F-2910-2010	Kent, Dennis/0000-0002-7677-2993; Mateus, Octavio/0000-0003-1253-3616; Mau, Malte/0000-0001-8321-0967													2245-7070						2020	68						95	132		10.37570/bgsd-2020-68-05	http://dx.doi.org/10.37570/bgsd-2020-68-05													WOS:000582599200001
J	Ababneh, L				Ababneh, Linah			Bristlecone pine paleoclimatic model for archeological patterns in the White Mountain of California	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL					22nd Pacific Climate Workshop	MAR 26-29, 2006	Pacific Grove, CA					Archeologists recognize that prehistoric human populations were a significant variable in the operation of past California ecosystem processes, and that a changing environment created constraints and opportunities for prehistoric cultural adaptation. The tic between paleoclimatology and archeology is an evolving interdisciplinary field of study that aims to facilitate a better understanding of prehistoric subsistence-settlement patterns relative to climate variability. A paleoclimatic model based on temperature inferences and precipitation reconstruction from tree-ring widths of bristlecone pine in the White Mountains of California is used to explain the distribution of prehistoric alpine villages in the White Mountains. The paleoclimatic model is visually and statistically compared with calendar ages converted from calibrated C-14 dates from the village sites. Results elucidate the role of water availability in the frequency and intensity of settlement, as 88% of the calendar dates associated with C-14 dates fall within wet periods (alpha = 0.05, p = 0.005). The coincidence of the calendar dates around above average precipitation periods confirms that long-term available resources are contingent on the availability of moisture, the key to life in the desert environment.

J	Winkler, S; Nesje, A				Winkler, S; Nesje, A			Moraine formation at an advancing temperate glacier: Brigsdalsbreen, western Norway	GEOGRAFISKA ANNALER SERIES A-PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY												Owing to increased winter balances especially since AD 1988/89, almost all valley outlet glaciers of Jostedals-breen in western Norway are experiencing the largest advance since that of the early 18th century, the regional "Little Ice Age" maximum. Brigsdalsbreen advanced 441 m between 1987 and 1997. By the end of this period, the glacier had reached the outlet of the proglacial lake Brigsdalsvatnet, ploughing into unfrozen, fine-grained, water-soaked glaciolimnic sediments from the lake bottom and forming frontal moraines. These moraines are characterised by a lack of internal structures and preferred fabric. Owing to the strong advance, the moraine morphology is constantly changing, leaving only temporary mordaine ridges. Observations made along the glacier front suggest that the formation of these moraines can best be described as "bulldozed moraines", since the term push moraine, commonly associated with advancing glaciers, should be restricted to permafrost environments. Different processes involved in moraine formation at frontal and lateral glacier margins result from variations in proglacial sediment properties, microrelief and glacier dynamics. Among these processes, large boulders left in the proglacial areas are pushed forward, forming pressure ridges on the distal side. Some of the largest boulders (c. 80-120 m(3)) are overturned or related by the glacier.																			0435-3676	1468-0459					1999	81A	1					17	30		10.1111/j.0435-3676.1999.00046.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0435-3676.1999.00046.x													WOS:000081593400002

Relative demand by double-crested cormorants and anglers for fish production from lakes on Manitoulin Island, Lake Huron	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The magnitude of angler harvest (kg.ha(-1).yr(-1)) and cormorant consumption (kg.ha(-1).yr(-1)) were compared for a set of lakes (N=11) on Manitoulin Island. Empirical models relating total phosphorus to total fish production as well as production to body mass were used to scope the possible range of fish production and to partition production among small, medium and large size segments of fish populations, respectively. Medium (66-112 g) and large (>200 g) size segments were defined as size categories targeted by cormorants (stomach diet analysis) and anglers (creel interviews), respectively. Angling effort and cormorant density were estimated from aerial surveys of the lake set during the open water season and for anglers during the winter ice-fishing season. Results showed that anglers harvested almost all large fish production, assuming the mean total fish production model, and 43% of large fish production under the more optimistic upper 80% prediction limit of total fish production. Cormorant consumption of medium fish production was less (39% using mean regression model; 15% using upper 80% prediction model) than angler consumption of large fish production. Anglers therefore imposed more population stress on their preferred sizes of fish than cormorants imposed on their preferred sizes of fish. Population stress was increased when cormorant consumption of medium size fish was discounted from contributing to large fish production. Angler harvest near (or above) sustainable yield levels will be exacerbated and appear as a fish collapse when cormorants consume fish production destined for fish size segments preferred by anglers.

J	Hammar, J				Hammar, J			Cannibals and parasites: conflicting regulators of bimodality in high latitude Arctic char, Salvelinus alpinus	OIKOS												Unexploited populations of Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) sampled in autonomous lake ecosystems in northern Svalbard demonstrate extraordinary catch curves with age and size frequency distributions characterized by discrete bimodality. Analyses of size-age relationship, summer diet and food-related intestinal parasite intensities of modal char groups revealed a pattern of discrete ontogenetic niche shifts. Life-history changes at age 10-15 and size 200-300 mm/50-300 g involved shifting from an initial mode of small-sized, slow-growing and sexually mature individuals feeding on micro-crustaceans and aquatic insects (Chironomidae, Trichoptera), to a terminal mode of large-sized and fast-growing cannibals. Cannibalism, however, was found to result in accumulation of cestodan parasites, of which Diphyllobothrium ditremum increases age-related mortality rates and may be lethal at 1500-2000 plerocercoids. Genetically allopatric populations with cannibalism demonstrated a female-biased sex ratio, primarily in the initial mode, suggesting sexual asynchrony in their ontogeny. By contrast, a small population of large-sized, non-cannibalistic Arctic char feeding exclusively on the large amphipod Gammaracanthus lacustris, demonstrated unimodal size and age frequency distribution, faster growth, an excess of males and lower parasite burden. Seasonal prey shortage and slow juvenile growth in association with fitness components favoring large body size is a suggested mechanism for inducing cannibalism. Although not the basic cause of bimodality as such, it is concluded that ontogenetic niche shift by cannibalism reinforces discrete age modal divergence resulting in the numerical preponderance of large-sized individuals in these marginal char populations. Cannibalism is thus considered an important strategy for survival of landlocked Arctic char in the High Arctic. As a conflicting cost to the more efficient use of available energy by larger individuals, the accumulation of cestodan parasites in cannibals, however, will reduce the survival rate of old individuals and accelerate their termination within this modal group.																			0030-1299	1600-0706				JAN	2000	88	1					33	47		10.1034/j.1600-0706.2000.880105.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1034/j.1600-0706.2000.880105.x													WOS:000085424600005

Recordings of Fast Paleomagnetic Reversals in a 1.2 Ma Greigite-Rich Sediment Archive From Lake Ohrid, Balkans	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH												State-of-the-art paleoclimate research strongly depends on the availability of time-equivalent markers as chronological control to disentangle interrelationships in the climate system from regional to global scale. Geomagnetic reversals are regarded as excellent age constraints because they are global events and independent from climatic conditions. However, spatial variations of timing and internal dynamics of reversals may limit their precision. Our 1.2 Ma high-resolution (similar to 25 cm/kyr) sediment record from Lake Ohrid is promising to precisely depict the Matuyama-Brunhes (MB) reversal and the Jaramillo subchron. Two generations of diagenetic ferrimagnetic minerals are present in glacial intervals of the Lake Ohrid record. Early diagenetic greigite acquired a quasi synsedimentary chemical magnetization, while a late diagenetic greigite formation, triggered by the upward diffusion of H2S-rich waters, obscures the polarity record at the top of the Jaramillo. Interglacial intervals are unaffected by greigite formation, likely due to low iron concentrations. Based on an orbitally tuned age model with tephrostratigraphic markers, the base of Jaramillo can be precisely dated to 1072.4 ka, and the MB reversal to 778.5 ka. Both polarity reversals occurred very rapidly in our record, lasting 2.3 and 1 kyr, respectively. Our results reveal that the dipole component of the Earth's magnetic field fell below the nondipole components only for a short duration in the Mediterranean region. The comparison of the timing of the MB boundary across different archives implies that the onset of the reversal provides a more synchronous age marker compared to often used midpoint ages.

Recruitment success was highly variable, with no clear relationship between spawning stock and recruitment. Furthermore, no regular recruitment failure from large spawning stocks that would imply over-compensation was detected. Since 1982, an 11-year period of very poor year classes occurred despite the spawning stock and larval density being at high enough levels to produce abundant year-classes in the beginning of this period. A comprehensive recession appeared at the same time in other vendace stocks in southern Finland. In lake Konnevesi, perch (Perca fluviatilis) stock increased rapidly during the vendace recession. High summer temperatures were revealed to strengthen the perch stock, especially in the 1980s, as indicated by CPUE data with a lag of two years. Perch probably delayed the recovery of vendace and it is also likely that its predation affected the dynamics of the vendace stock even in the beginning of the recession. We suggest that predation pressure as a whole was an important factor for the onset and duration of the vendace recession.																			0003-455X	1797-2450				FEB 26	2004	41	1					329	338																WOS:000220364300037

First-season growth and food of YOY pike (Esox lucius) are habitat specific within a lake	FISHERIES RESEARCH												Piscivorous fish are important predators in aquatic systems and as such they can have far-reaching effects on ecosystem composition and function. These effects depend on piscivore predation rates and behaviour, and recruitment of young-of-the-year fish into piscivory can hereby govern ecosystem properties. Growth and recruitment can differ between water bodies due to e.g. general productivity, but information on variation in juvenile growth and body condition between habitats within water bodies is scant. We here evaluate growth, body condition, food occurrence and stomach contents of an important piscivore, pike (Esox lucius), over the first growth season in two contrasting and spatially separated homogenous habitat types (emergent and submerged vegetation separated by 50 m of open sand) within the same lake. Individual size and body condition in pike were higher in the submerged vegetation early in the season, whereas by the end of their first summer pike were larger and in higher body condition in the emergent vegetation, in spite of occurrence of zooplankton, macro -invertebrates and fish prey being overall higher in the submerged vegetation. Pike showed habitat-specific patterns of macroinvertebrate consumption (higher in the submerged vegetation) and date-specific patterns of zooplankton (higher early in the season), macroinvertebrate (lower late in the season) and fish (higher later in the season) consumption that were not a result of occurrence of food types, as occurrence and consumption patterns did not match. We conclude that pike that hatched in the emergent vegetation habitat were larger towards the end of the season and, hence, these pike should have a higher survival probability and possibly contribute more to pike population density and predation at older ages, but also that submerged vegetation provides an alternative and added recruitment environment for pike in shallow lake ecosystems.

These consisted of two regional rum of approximately 100 km in length from James Bay to the Kinosheo Lake and 13-km runs in the form of ''L'' and grid patterns near the Atmospheric Environment service (AES) tower in the Kinosheo Lake area. An examination of the average fluxes shows that day-to-day differences were larger than the spatial differences. Significant correlations were found between the fluxes of CO2, sensible heat and latent heat, and selected environmental characteristics, such as air temperature, vapor pressure deficit, surface temperature minus air temperature, and incident solar radiation, for different sections of the NOWES area. The presentation of the spatial variations of aircraft-based fluxes of CO2, sensible heat, and latent heat over a 13 km X 13 km area near Kinosheo Lake permits an evaluation of the spatial representativeness of the AES tower observations.																			2169-897X					JAN 20	1994	99	D1					1551	1561		10.1029/93JD01296	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/93JD01296													WOS:A1994MT03200042

Hydrological forcing of a recent trophic surge in Lake Winnipeg	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Nutrient enrichment leading to eutrophication of lakes is frequently attributed to increasing anthropogenic loading to the watershed. We use a phosphorus mass balance model to demonstrate that a discharge increase in a major tributary contributed more than increased anthropogenic loading to a recent sudden doubling of total phosphorus (TP) and a shift to a cyanobacteria-dominated plankton population in Lake Winnipeg. Runoff from the Red River watershed rose abruptly during the mid-1990s. The decadal mean discharge has since been more than 50% higher than for any previous decade in the century-long record. Widespread spring flooding has become common. TP concentration roughly doubles during floods, magnifying the effect of higher runoff on downstream phosphorus loading. Concentrations of both dissolved and particulate phases are raised by flooding. Over 90% of dissolved phosphorus downstream of flooded farm land in one tributary was in the form of highly bio-available orthophosphate. From 1994 to 1999, TP in the lake rose from less than 30 to more than 50 mg m(-3). It has since remained over 50% higher than before the mid-1990s. We use the phosphorus model to demonstrate that the change in Red River discharge alone would have caused a sustained 32% increase compared to when phosphorus was first routinely monitored in the 1970s, while direct increases in the rate of anthropogenic loading alone would have caused only a 14% increase. It required both increased loading to the land and higher runoff to produce the observed increase in TP in the lake. (c) 2012 International Association for Great Lakes Research.

J	Hawes, I; Schwarz, AM				Hawes, I; Schwarz, AM			Photosynthesis in an extreme shade environment: Benthic microbial mats from Lake Hoare, a permanently ice-covered Antarctic lake	JOURNAL OF PHYCOLOGY												We investigated the composition of benthic microbial mats in permanently ice-covered Lake Hoare, Antarctica, and their irradiance vs. photosynthetic oxygen exchange relationships. Mats could be subdivided into three distinct depth zones: a seasonally ice-free "moat" zone and two under-ice zones. The upper under-ice zone extended from below the 3.5 m thick ice to approximately 13 m and the lower from below 13 m to 22 m. Moat mats were acclimated to the high irradiance they experienced during summer. They contained photoprotective pigments, predominantly those characteristic of cyanobacteria, and had high compensation and saturating irradiances (E-c and E-k) of 75 and 130 mu mol photons.m(-2).s(-1), respectively. The moat mats used light inefficiently. The upper under-ice community contained both cyanobacteria and diatoms. Within this zone, biomass (as pigments) increased with increasing depth, reaching a maximum at 10 m. Phycoerythrin was abundant in this zone, with shade acclimation and efficiency of utilization of incident Light increasing with depth to a maximum of 0.06 mel C fixed.mol(-1) incident photons under light-limiting conditions. Precipitation of inorganic carbon as calcite was associated with this community, representing up to 50% of the carbon sequestered into the sediment. The lower under-ice zone was characterized by a decline in pigment concentrations with depth and an increasing prevalence of diatoms. Photosynthesis in this community was highly shade acclimated and efficient, with E-c and E-k below 0.5 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1) and 2 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1), respectively, and maximum yields of 0.04 mel C fixed.mol(-1) incident quanta. Carbon uptake in situ by both under-ice and moat mats was estimated at up to 100 and 140 mg.m(-2).day(-1), based on the photosynthesis-irradiance curves, incident irradiance, and light attenuation by ice and the water column.

The layer was short-lived (.apprx. 2 weeks), had a maximum cell concentration four times greater than in the waters above and below, and formed within the pycnocline at the silicon gradient and the base of the euphotic zone. The mechanisms governing the formation of sub-surface maxima were examined in a 4 m tall stratified laboratory column using live and formaldehyde-killed cultures of A. formosa. Dead cells added to the top of the column formed a broad layer as they sedimented through the density gradient. This was in contrast to a more discrete maximum with sharp lower boundary obtained using silicon-depleted cells as they encountered a silicacline within the pycnocline. There were marked changes in the chemical composition of live cells during the phases of growth and settlement in the experimental column. Silicon-depleted cells entering the deep silicacline showed a decrease in sinking rate within a period of 1 day.																			0142-7873	1464-3774				NOV	1989	11	6					1169	1184		10.1093/plankt/11.6.1169	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/11.6.1169													WOS:A1989AZ05100005

Based on the analysis of the temporal and spatial variation characteristics of environmental factors, this study uses a support vector machine regression (SVR) algorithm to establish a chlorophyll a (Chl-a) prediction model and conduct Chl-a sensitivity analysis. In 2018, the average Chl-a content was 126.25 ug/L. The maximum total nitrogen (TN) content was 16.68 mg/L and high year-round. The average -NH4+-N and total phosphorous (TP) contents were only 0.78 and 0.18 mg/L. The content of -NH4+-N was higher in spring and increased significantly along the water flow, while TP decreased slightly along the water flow. We used a radial basis function kernel SVR model and tenfold cross-validation method to optimize parameters. The penalty parameter c was 1.4142, the kernel function parameter g was 1, and the training and verification errors were only 0.032 and 0.067, respectively, indicating a good model fit. Based on a sensitivity analysis of the SVR prediction model, the maximum sensitivity coefficients of Chl-a to TP and WT were 0.571 and 0.394, respectively, and the contributions were 33% and 22%, respectively. The next highest sensitivity coefficients were those of DO (0.28, 16%) and pH (0.243, 14%). The sensitivity coefficients of TN and -NH4+- N were the lowest. According to the current water environment pollution conditions, TP is the limiting factor of Chl-a in the Qingshui River, and it is also the main prevention and control factor of phytoplankton outbreak.																			0167-6369	1573-2959				JUN	2023	195	6							698	10.1007/s10661-023-11276-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-023-11276-9								37209292					WOS:000993075800004
J	MOHRMANN, KJM				MOHRMANN, KJM			RECLAIMED PEAT SOILS AND THEIR AGRICULTURAL IMPORTANCE	SOIL SCIENCE												The peat soil areas of the Netherlands roughly fall into 3 classes. When properly reclaimed some of them have a high agricultural value. In reclaiming them it is essential to know whether they are high-peat areas cut away or low-peat areas dug off. Each of the 3 classes of peat presents a special problem in the reclamation process. In the 1st class the peat has largely disappeared leaving lakes imbedded in clay. Once the lakes are drained this clay makes valuable farm land. The 2d class consists of a thin layer of peat overlying clay. The peat is mixed with the clay. This also makes good agric. land. The 3d class consists of thick layers of peat overlying clay. In this case the surface of the peat is leveled and the coarse material removed. This land is suitable for pasture. When this peat is covered with sand to a depth of ca. 12 cm. it provides productive "dalgronden" or reclaimed high peat. The "dalgronden" are used mainly for cultivated crops and are especially known for high yields of potatoes, rye and oats.																			0038-075X	1538-9243					1952	74	1					57	68		10.1097/00010694-195207000-00007	http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/00010694-195207000-00007													WOS:A1952UU17200007
J	Ortiz-Llorente, MJ; Alvarez-Cobelas, M				Ortiz-Llorente, M. J.; Alvarez-Cobelas, M.			Comparison of biogenic methane emissions from unmanaged estuaries, lakes, oceans, rivers and wetlands	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												A literature review of quantitative data was carried out to conduct a cross-system study on methane emissions relating peak emissions (PE) and annual emissions (AE) in five types of non-managed ecosystems: estuaries, lakes, oceans, streams and wetlands. PE spanned eight orders of magnitude (0.015 mu g CH4 m(-2) h(-1)-300 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1)) while AE spanned seven (0.078-19044 g CH4 m(-2) yr(-1)). PE and AE were strongly related worldwide (r(2) = 0.93). There was no relationship between AE and latitude, with highly variable PE across latitudes and climates. The coefficient of variation (CV) was greatest for emissions in oceans and estuaries, while the highest emission rate was recorded in wetlands and lakes. Efflux from coastal areas and estuaries was higher than that from upwelling areas and deep seas. Concerning wetland types, marshes showed the highest PE with the highest wetland emissions occurring in sites dominated by big helophytes. Non-stratifying- and eutrophic lakes displayed more emissions than other lake types, but there was no environmental variable that might predict methane emissions from lakes on a worldwide basis. Generally, most ecosystem types followed a seasonal pattern of emissions, with a maximum in summer, except in estuaries which did not show any distinct pattern. Regarding the importance of hot spots within most ecosystems, more spatial variability of CH4 emissions was observed in lakes than in wetlands and oceans; however, no relationship between emissions and spatial variability was found. A positive relationship, albeit weak, was found between methane flux and either temperature or irradiance in wetlands; a narrow range of both negative and positive values of the water table promoted CH4 emissions. Previously, little was known about the factors controlling efflux from river and marine environments. Our study suggests that local conditions are important in controlling CH4 emissions, because the variability explained by the more commonly studied abiotic factors is low worldwide. This precludes the use of these variables to develop models to predict emissions at regional scales or wider, despite the many attempts made in the past. This makes local assessments of emissions essential, particularly in warm, temperate and tropical areas of the world. Future research aiming to shed light on CH4 fluxes from estuaries, lakes, oceans, rivers and wetlands must: 1) produce more detailed data on controlling factors; 2) increase efforts to fully characterize spatial and temporal heterogeneity; 3) combine bottom-up (measurements) and top-down (modelling) approaches.

Impact of some heavy metal accumulation in different organs on fish quality from Bardawil Lake and human health risks assessment	GEOCHEMICAL TRANSACTIONS												Bardawil Lake is a unique aquatic ecosystem that provides a habitat for various fish and other marine organisms. This study aimed to analyze the quality of fish species to prove that this lake is free of pollution, not other Egyptian lakes, due to the accumulation of some heavy metals (Cd, Pb, Cu, and Zn) in various tissues of fish species that were caught from this lake. Thirty-five fish samples were caught during the Spring of 2018 from seven different species: Mugil cephalus, Liza auratus, Sparus aurata, Dicentrarchus labrax, Siganus rivulatus, Anguilla angilla, and Solae solea. The Association of Official Analytical Chemists methods using a spectrophotometer determined the biochemical composition. In contrast, atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS) was employed to determine the heavy metals expressed by mu g/g wet weight. Results exposed that the accumulation of essential micronutrient (Cu, Zn) content was higher than toxic elements (Cd & Pb) in muscles in order to Zn > Cu > Pb > Cd. Muscles < gills < liver in order of all metals except Pb with order muscles < liver < gills. The metals studied in the muscles were lower than those set by the WHO and the EU standards. The carcinogenic risk with lower allowable limits of 1 x 10(-6) to 1 x 10(-4) in both normal and high consumption groups; target and total target hazard quotients (THQ & HI) in muscles were < 1. The biochemical composition level was highest in the liver, except for protein, which was highest in muscle for all fish species. There is no evidence of harmful contaminants in the muscular tissue of the fish sampled from Bardawil Lake, although fishing activity. However, customers should know that health concerns may be associated with overeating fish.

Mid-depth temperature maximum in an estuarine lake	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												The mid-depth temperature maximum (TeM) was measured in an estuarine Bol'shoi Vilyui Lake (Kamchatka peninsula, Russia) in summer 2015. We applied 1D k-epsilon. model LAKE to the case, and found it successfully simulating the phenomenon. We argue that the main prerequisite for mid-depth TeM development is a salinity increase below the freshwater mixed layer, sharp enough in order to increase the temperature with depth not to cause convective mixing and double diffusion there. Given that this condition is satisfied, the TeMmagnitude is controlled by physical factors which we identified as: radiation absorption below the mixed layer, mixed-layer temperature dynamics, vertical heat conduction and water-sediments heat exchange. In addition to these, we formulate the mechanism of temperature maximum pumping', resulting from the phase shift between diurnal cycles of mixed-layer depth and temperature maximum magnitude. Based on the LAKE model results we quantify the contribution of the above listed mechanisms and find their individual significance highly sensitive to water turbidity. Relying on physical mechanisms identified we define environmental conditions favouring the summertime TeM development in salinity-stratified lakes as: small-mixed layer depth (roughly, similar to<2m), transparent water, daytime maximum of wind and cloudless weather. We exemplify the effect of mixed-layer depth on TeM by a set of selected lakes.

J	Spyra, A				Spyra, Aneta			Acidic, neutral and alkaline forest ponds as a landscape element affecting the biodiversity of freshwater snails	SCIENCE OF NATURE												In recent years, the number of areas remaining under the influence of acidity has increased. At all levels of ecosystems, biodiversity decreases with acidification, due to the elimination of species that are most sensitive to low pH. Forest ponds belong to a specific group that varied in location, a huge amount of leaf litter, and isolation from other aquatic environments. They are crucial in the industrial landscape with well-developed industry and human activity. The aim was to investigate the relative importance of water chemistry in explaining snail assemblage compositions and species richness in forest ponds of contrasting pH. Patterns in gastropod communities were determined from an analysis in 26 forest ponds with multivariate gradient analysis. Ponds ranged in a base mean pH from 3.0 to 9.0. pH has been found to be an important factor influencing gastropod fauna. Neutral ponds support diverse communities, typical of small water bodies. In two acidic pond types, snail fauna was different. Among the species characteristic for acidic ponds (pH < 6) were Anisus spirorbis and Aplexa hypnorum. The greatest distinct characterised alkaline ponds with the numerous appearance of alien Physa acuta. The most diverse gastropod fauna was found in neutral ponds, whereas the lowest degree of diversity was found in ponds with the lowest pH. Current knowledge of pH-associated changes in aquatic ecosystems is still incomplete because anthropogenic acidification is a recent phenomenon. It is extremely important in forest habitats, since they react more intensively to climatic factors and are often used in landscape management and planning.																			0028-1042	1432-1904				OCT	2017	104	9-10							73	10.1007/s00114-017-1495-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00114-017-1495-z													WOS:000412340100005

Dispersal was measured by recording the number of immigrants to a removal grid and by tracking radiocollared individuals. The observed decline was not due to dispersal, as a maximum of 28% of all losses of radiocollared animals was due to dispersal. Dispersal rate (as measured by number of immigrants to the removal grid per individual on the control grid) was negatively correlated (-0.51, P < 0.01) with the rate of population increase. Highest dispersal rates occurred in the winters when hare populations were at peak and early decline densities. Dispersers at this time were lighter in weight than residents. Results are discussed in light of current hypotheses attempting to explain dispersal in cyclic small mammals. Results are consistent with the hypothesis that food shortage is responsible for increased rates of dispersal at peak population densities. Comparisons of dispersal, as monitored by radiotelemetry, vs. immigration to a removal grid, suggests that removal grids overestimate dispersal, particularly at high densities when removal grids may attract animals because food supplies are relatively favorable there.

J	SPROSS, J				SPROSS, J			MCARTHUR RIVER PROJECT - THE FUTURE OF KEY LAKE	CIM BULLETIN												The Key Lake mill has operated since the fall from both Key Lake open pits will be depleted by 1997. It is to use this mill, located about 60 km southwest of McArthur, to process the McArthur River ore. While the geological data collected so far on the McArthur deposit are encouraging, more information of the deposit is needed before any detailed mine planning can begin. The surface drilling PrOgram identified the orebody and provided information on the geomechanical and hydrological properties of the overlying sandstone. It was proposed to conduct an underground exploration program to further delineate the orebody. This was approved following a public hearing and review process. This program involves the sinking of a 630 metre deep shaft and the driving of one or two drifts along a portion of the orebody. From these drifts, exploration drilling every 10 m to 15 m through the orebody will provide the information required for the preparation of a feasibility study and an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS).																			0317-0926					JUL-AUG	1994	87	982					51	56																WOS:A1994PC17100005

Conservation priorities for freshwater biodiversity: The Key Biodiversity Area approach refined and tested for continental Africa	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Freshwater ecosystems represent one of the most threatened broad habitat types globally. Despite containing around a third of all vertebrates, area-based approaches to conservation planning rarely include freshwater species as an explicit target for conservation. Here we describe and apply a globally applicable methodology comparable to those for other groups (i.e. Important Bird Areas) to identify river and lake catchments that represent, or contain, freshwater Key Biodiversity Areas. We discuss the rationale behind the methodology and propose appropriate definitions and quantitative threshold values for the selection criteria. Thresholds are developed through spatial analysis of species information for four comprehensively assessed freshwater taxonomic groups in continental Africa, comprising 4203 species, as recently assessed for the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (TM). To illustrate application of the methodology freshwater Key Biodiversity Areas are identified across continental Africa, and conservation planning software used to prioritise a network of catchments that captures 99% of the total species complement within catchments covering ca. 20% of the total land area. Within these prioritised catchments only 19% of river length falls within existing Protected Areas suggesting that, given the high connectivity within freshwater ecosystems and their dependence upon catchment management for effective conservation, modification or expansion of the protected area network is required to increase effective conservation of freshwater species. By applying this methodology, gaps in the coverage of freshwater species by existing Protected Areas can be identified and used to inform conservation policy and investment to ensure it is inclusive of, and effective for, freshwater biodiversity.

Tectonic and climate controls on Neogene environmental change in the Zhada Basin, southwestern Tibetan Plateau	GEOLOGY												Evidence for a long-lived, high-elevation plateau contradicts the hypothesis that uplift of the southern Tibetan Plateau was a driver of late Miocene-Pliocene changes in ecology and monsoon strength. We illuminate the mechanisms underlying late Miocene-Pliocene environmental changes using a multi-proxy record from the Zhada Basin, southwestern Tibetan Plateau, between ca. 9.2 and 2.3 Ma. An increase in mean carbonate delta O-18(c) and delta O-13(c) values, decrease in grain size, and onset of lacustrine deposition at 6.0 Ma is attributed to local tectonic damming and transition from a through-flowing fluvial system to a terminal lake. This is followed at 3.5 Ma by a decrease in lake size indicated by synchronous increase in grain size, progradation of lake-margin depositional systems, increase in delta O-18(c) values at lake-central locations, and divergence in delta O-18(c) values between inflowing and lake water. We attribute lake shrinking to decreasing Indian summer monsoon precipitation due to the combined effects of decreased southern Tibetan Plateau elevations and cooler Indian Ocean temperatures. We attribute increased grain size and delta O-18(c) value variability to changes in fluvial discharge due to increased sensitivity to orbital forcing, itself possibly coupled with onset of glacial conditions at high elevations. These mechanisms link regional tectonic events to Pliocene changes in climate and environmental conditions, including erosion, granularity, sediment accumulation rates, and potentially biological turnover on and around the Tibetan Plateau.

J	Castilho-Noll, MSM; Arcifa, MS				Castilho-Noll, Maria Stela Maioli; Arcifa, Marlene Sofia			Mesocosm experiment on the impact of invertebrate predation on zooplankton of a tropical lake	AQUATIC ECOLOGY												Invertebrate predation on zooplankton was investigated in mesocosms in the shallow tropical Lake Monte Alegre, Sauo Paulo State, Brazil, in the summer of 1999. Two treatments were applied: one with natural densities of prey and the predators Chaoborus brasiliensis and the water mite Krendowskia sp. (Pr+), and another without predators (Pr-). Three enclosures (volume: 6.6 m(3) of water per enclosure) per treatment were installed in the sediment of the deepest area of the lake (5.0 m). At the beginning, Chaoborus larvae were present in Pr- enclosures, because of technical difficulties in preventing their entrance, but they virtually disappeared in the course of the experiment. Water mites were almost absent in Pr- enclosures. Chaoborus predation negatively influenced the Daphnia gessneri population, but not the populations of the copepods Tropocyclops prasinus and Thermocyclops decipiens and the rotifers Keratella spp. Death rates of Daphnia were generally significantly higher in the Pr+ treatment; Daphnia densities increased after the disappearance of Chaoborus in Pr-. Copepod losses to predation in the experiment may be compensated by higher fecundity, shorter egg development time, and lower pressure on egg-bearing females, resulting in a lower susceptibility to Chaoborus predation.

The model was calibrated for tidal constituents as well as velocity and sediment concentration across channel transects. The calibrated model was then used to simulate full spring neap tidal cycles under constant low flow upstream boundary conditions, with grain size variation in suspended load represented using two sediment fractions. Flow and sediment flux results through distributary channel cross-sections were examined for spatial and temporal variability with the goal of characterizing the role of tides in sediment reworking and delta development. The Wax Lake Delta has prograded through channel extension, river mouth bar deposition, and channel bifurcation. Here we show that tidal modulation of currents influences suspended sand transport, and spatial acceleration through distributary channels at low tides is sufficient to suspend sand in distal reaches during lower flows. The basinward-increasing transport capacity in distributary channels indicates that erosive channel extension could be an important process, even during non-flood events.																			0144-7815		978-1-907161-45-2				2014	367						391	398																WOS:000357222000051

Modelling and forecasting the heterogeneous distribution of picocyanobacteria in the tropical Lajes Reservoir (Brazil) by evolutionary computation	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Five years of water quality data from six stations across the mesotrophic and oligomictic Lajes Reservoir (Brazil) were utilized to develop 7-day ahead forecasting models for the picocyanobacteria Cyanodictyon imperfectum, Cyanogranis ferruginea and Synechococcus sp. by means of the hybrid evolutionary algorithm HEA. The data included physical and chemical water quality parameters as well as abundance data of the three picocyanobacteria. Models based on site-specific data of six monitoring stations forecasted population dynamics of Synechococcus with coefficients of determination (r (2)) between 0.58 for and 0.88, of Cyanodictyon with r (2) between 0.5 and 0.89 and of Cyanogranis with r (2) between 0.53 and 0.77. Despite phosphorus limiting conditions the sensitivity analysis revealed that the three picocyanobacteria responded much stronger to nitrate rather than to phosphate concentrations throughout the Lajes Reservoir suggesting that cyanobacteria may have adopted the sulphur-for-phosphorus strategy by utilizing sulfolipids instead. Cyanogranis displayed a negative relationship with increasing water temperature indicating its higher competitiveness at internal nutrient supply and low light levels during winter turnover. The resulting models will inform operational intervention and prevention of fast growth and dispersal of picocyanobacteria in Lajes Reservoir, and reveal environmental thresholds for outbreaks of such events.					; Huszar, Vera/J-7126-2012; Filho, Izidro/MCK-5672-2025	Castelo Branco, Christina W/0000-0002-0509-171X; Huszar, Vera/0000-0002-8096-1404; Ferreira de Sousa-Filho, Izidro/0000-0001-9210-0399; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				MAY	2015	749	1					53	67		10.1007/s10750-014-2144-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-014-2144-6													WOS:000349968400005
J	Burkholder, EF				Burkholder, EF			Differences between NGVD29 and NAVD88 in Southeastern Wisconsin	JOURNAL OF SURVEYING ENGINEERING-ASCE												The Southeastern Wisconsin Regional Planning Commission (SEWRPC) has, over the past 30 years, established and promoted use of elevations referenced to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 (NGVD29). Through international agreement, cooperation, and participation the vertical datums for the entire North American continent were recomputed, readjusted, and published as the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD88). This paper summarizes a report prepared to describe differences between those vertical datums throughout the seven-county region served by SEWRPC. The report also includes a brief discussion of the International Great Lakes Datums (IGLD) and describes how IGLD 1985 is related to NAVD88. Conclusions published in the report are that within the seven-county SEWRPC region: (1) third-order datum differences can be interpolated from an isohypsometric map available from SEWRPC; (2) second-order datum differences can be obtained using VERTCON, an interpolation program available from the National Geodetic Survey, Silver Spring, Md; and (3) datum differences at first-order benchmarks should be determined on the basis of field surveys using first-order equipment and observational techniques.																			0733-9453					MAY	1997	123	2					77	85		10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9453(1997)123:2(77)	http://dx.doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9453(1997)123:2(77)													WOS:A1997WW29000003

This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the inorganic and organic chemistry of snow cover in the icefield and a comparison against previous results obtained in fresh water. Snow samples were collected in the summer of 2017 in the Warszawa Icefield area. Sampling points are located along two transects: between the Arctowski Polish Polar Station and the Carlini Base (N = 4), and from the forefield to the upper part of Ecology Glacier (N = 5). In the snow samples, (1) basic ions, (2) major trace metals and metalloids (and B), and (3) polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were detected and quantified. Additionally, the parameters of pH, specific electrolytic conductivity (SEC25) and total organic carbon (TOC) were determined. The results show a low concentration of inorganic elements (<30 mg/L), TOC (<1 mg/L) and PAHs (0.11-1.4 ng/L) in collected snow samples. A slight increase in PAHs and heavy-metals concentration has been observed at the marginal parts of the icefield, which suggests the impact of scientific stations. Based on this result there is a need to conduct research on pollutant levels in ice cores on King George Island to assess the risk associated with rapid glacier thawing and pollution remobilisation.

The OWLeS IOP2b Lake-Effect Snowstorm: Shoreline Geometry and the Mesoscale Forcing of Precipitation	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW												Long-lake-axis-parallel (LLAP) lake-effect precipitation systems that form when the flow is parallel to the long axis of an elongated body of water frequently produce intense, highly localized snowfall. Conceptual models of these LLAP systems typically emphasize the role of thermally forced land breezes from the flanking shorelines, with low-level convergence and ascent centered near the lake axis. In reality, other factors such as shoreline geometry and differential surface roughness can strongly influence LLAP systems. Here a WRF Model simulation is used to examine the mesoscale forcing of lake-effect precipitation over Lake Ontario during IOP2b of the Ontario Winter Lake-effect Systems (OWLeS) field campaign. In the simulation, the large-scale flow, shoreline geometry, and differential surface heating and roughness contribute to the development of three major airmass boundaries. The first is a land-breeze front that forms along a bulge in the south shoreline between St. Catharines, Ontario, Canada, and Thirty Mile Point, New York; extends downstream over eastern Lake Ontario; and plays a primary role in the LLAP system development. The second is a land-breeze front that forms along the southeast shoreline near Oswego, New York; extends downstream and obliquely across the LLAP system near Tug Hill; and influences inland precipitation processes. The third is a convergence zone that extends downstream from the north shoreline near Point Petre, Ontario, Canada; and contributes to the intermittent development of lake-effect precipitation north of the primary LLAP system. These results highlight the multifaceted nature of LLAP system development over Lake Ontario, especially the contributions of shoreline geometry and mesoscale airmass boundaries.

Microbial carbon processing in oligotrophic Lake Lucerne (Switzerland): results of in situ 13C-labelling studies	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Although lakes play a major role in the storage of organic carbon, processes involved are not yet very well characterized, especially for oligotrophic lakes. Whether a lake functions as a net source or sink for carbon depends on relative rates of primary production, inputs of terrestrial organic matter and respiration. The microbial community will affect the efficiency of carbon cycling and thereby potential carbon storage. Because the organic matter fluxes are smaller in oligotrophic lakes they have been studied less intensively with respect to their carbon cycling compared to eutrophic lakes. Whether they play an appreciable role in freshwater carbon cycling relies on unraveling primary and secondary production. Here we present the results from such a study in oligotrophic Lake Lucerne, Switzerland. Based on in situ carbon isotopic labelling experiments using dark, glucose-labelled and transparent, DIC-labelled bottles positioned at different depths in the water column, we conclude that even though the photic zone was very deep, integrated primary productivity was consistently low. The carbon processing efficiency of the heterotrophic producers was such that photosynthesized organic matter was fully consumed, even during times of maximum productivity. This implies that the heterotrophic producers were well adapted to rapidly respond to a temporary increase in primary productivity, which is in line with calculated bacterial growth efficiencies in the surface water layer. Highest glucose-based productivity, as a measure of the heterotrophic potential, was observed in the deepest parts of the water column. Chemoautotrophy was shown at 60 m water depth and is of relatively minor importance for overall fluxes. Mixotrophy was recognized as a strategy to keep up production when light conditions become less favorable for autotrophic growth. A mesocosm experiment earlier in the year indicated lower primary production, which agrees well with the timing of this experiment preceding the annual spring bloom. During the low-productivity season the coupling between phytoplankton and bacterial production was much weaker and potentially more organic matter could escape recycling at that time, although quantitatively fluxes remained very low.

Gale Crater: Formation and post-impact hydrous environments	PLANETARY AND SPACE SCIENCE												Gale Crater, the landing site of the 2011 Mars Science Laboratory mission, formed in the Late Noachian. It is a 150 km diameter complex impact structure with a central mound (Mount Sharp), the original features of which may be transitional between a central peak and peak ring impact structure. The impact might have melted portions of the substrate to a maximum depth of similar to 17 km and produced a minimum of 3600 km(3) of impact melt, half of which likely remained within the crater. The bulk of this impact melt would have pooled in an annular depression surrounding the central uplift, creating an impact melt pool as thick as 0.5-1 km. The ejecta blanket surrounding Gale may have been as thick as similar to 600 m, which has implications for the amount of erosion that has occurred since Gale Crater formed. After the impact, a hydrothermal system may have been active for several hundred thousand years and a crater lake with associated sediments is likely to have formed. The hydrothermal system, and associated lakes and springs, likely caused mineral alteration and precipitation. In the presence of S-rich host rocks, the alteration phases are modelled to contain sheet silicates, quartz, sulphates, and sulphides. Modelled alteration assemblages may be more complex if groundwater interaction persisted after initial alteration. The warm-water environment might have provided conditions supportive of life. Deep fractures would have allowed for hydraulic connectivity into the deep subsurface, where biotic chemistry (and possibly other evidence of life) may be preserved. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Over an 8-yr period, the average biomass of phytoplankton in the basin receiving carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus (in ratios of 10:5:1) increased 4 to 8 times and the biomass in the basin receiving only carbon and nitrogen (in ratios of 10:5) increased 2 to 4 times over non-fertilized years. The basin receiving all three nutrients consistently had blooms in later summer which were dominated by nitrogen fixing species of cyanophytes. In comparison with unfertilized reference lakes, the proportion of phytoplankton in fertilized basins which was available to zooplankton as food was 10 times greater in the basin receiving all three nutrients, and two times greater in the basin receiving only nitrogen and carbon. When fertilization of both basins was stopped, species composition and levels of biomass reverted within a year to the composition and biomass levels of phytoplankton observed in the reference lakes and remained at those levels for 2 further years of study.																			0706-652X	1205-7533					1987	44			1			35	46																WOS:A1987L149200003

Elevated temperatures increase the toxicity of pesticide mixtures to juvenile coho salmon	AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY												Pesticide mixtures and elevated temperatures are parallel freshwater habitat stressors for Pacific salmon in the western United States. Certain combinations of organophosphate (OP) insecticides are known to synergistically increase neurotoxicity in juvenile salmon. The chemicals interact to potentiate the inhibition of brain acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and disrupt swimming behavior. The metabolic activation and detoxification of OPs involve temperature-sensitive enzymatic processes. Salmon are ectothermic, and thus the degree of synergism may vary with ambient temperature in streams, rivers, and lakes. Here we assess the influence of water temperature (12-21 degrees C) on the toxicity of ethoprop and malathion, alone and in combination, to juvenile coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch). A mixture of ethoprop (0.9 mu g/L) and malathion (0.75 mu g/L.) produced synergistic AChE inhibition at 12 degrees C, and the degree of neurotoxicity approximately doubled with a modest temperature increase to 18 degrees C. Slightly lower concentrations of ethoprop (0.5 mu g/L) combined with malathion (0.4 mu g/L) did not inhibit brain AChE activity but did produce a temperature-dependent reduction in liver carboxylesterase (CaE). The activity of CaE was very sensitive to the inhibitory effects of ethoprop alone and both ethoprop-malathion combinations across all temperatures. Our findings are an example of how non-chemical habitat attributes can increase the relative toxicity of OP mixtures. Surface temperatures currently exceed water quality criteria in many western river segments, and summer thermal extremes are expected to become more frequent in a changing climate. These trends reinforce the importance of pollution reduction strategies to enhance ongoing salmon conservation and recovery efforts. Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Gabka, M; Lamentowicz, M				Gabka, Maciej; Lamentowicz, Mariusz			Vegetation-Environment Relationships in Peatlands Dominated by Sphagnum fallax in Western Poland	FOLIA GEOBOTANICA												We investigated species composition and relative abundance of Sphagnum fallax dominated peatlands in relation to measured environmental variables on the basis of 26 sites in the Wielkopolska region. Most studied plots were characterized by soft waters, poor in Ca2+ but rich in nutrients, especially N-NH4 (+) and P-PO4 (3-), with high electrolytic conductivity and high DOC (dissolved organic carbon) concentration. Six of the 19 measured variables of surface water chemistry (DOC, pH, SO4 (2-), P-PO4 (3-), Na+ and Ca2+) significantly explained 23% of the variation in floristic composition. In 65 vegetation plots, 107 species were observed. Cluster analysis revealed four types of vegetation in the studied mires. Sphagnum fallax was the most abundant species and formed plant communities in a wide range of habitats: in floating mats, with the plants usually adjoining the mineral basin edge (e.g. E. vaginatum, Andromeda polifolia and Ledum palustre) as well as it occupied central parts of Sphagnum lawn (e.g. Eriophorum angustifolium) and rich fen habitats (e.g. Carex rostrata or Phragmites australis). In Wielkopolska terrestrializating peatlands, four variables determine the poor-rich gradient: conductivity, DOC, SiO2 dissolved, Ca2+ and alkalinity. This study provides new data on the ecology and typology of Sphagnum peatlands in western Poland.

J	Stachelek, J; Soranno, PA				Stachelek, Jemma; Soranno, Patricia A.			Does freshwater connectivity influence phosphorus retention in lakes?	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Lake water residence time and depth are known to be strong predictors of phosphorus (P) retention. However, there is substantial variation in P retention among lakes with the same depth and residence time. One potential explanatory factor for this variation is differences in freshwater connectivity of lakes (i.e., the type and amount of freshwater connections to a lake), which can influence watershed P trapping or the particulate load fraction of P delivered to lakes via stream connections. To examine the relationship between P retention and connectivity, we quantified several different measures of connectivity including those that reflect downstream transport of material (sediment, water, and nutrients) within lake-stream networks (lake-stream-based metrics) as well as those that reflect transport of material from hillslope and riparian areas adjacent to watershed stream networks (stream-based metrics). Because it is not always clear what spatial extent is appropriate for determining functional differences in connectivity among lakes, we compared connectivity metrics at two important spatial extents: the lake subwatershed extent and the lake watershed extent. We found that variation in P retention among lakes was more strongly associated with connectivity metrics measured at the broader lake watershed extent rather than metrics measured at the finer lake subwatershed extent. Our results suggest that both connectivity between lakes and streams as well as connectivity of lakes and their terrestrial watersheds influence P retention.

The investigated post-mining lakes were very young compared to glacial lakes and represent early stages of ecosystem succession. Despite their different ages and morphometries, they are all mesotrophic and have good water quality. They have not been supplied with phosphorus and nitrogen, which can cause excessive development of pelagic phytoplankton; as a result, they share low chlorophyll a (Chl a) content, low phytoplankton biomass, and relatively high water transparency. Low abundance and species richness of zooplankton indicate low trophic levels in all of the lakes. Chl a in Lakes Przykona and Bogdaw were within the range typical of mesotrophic lakes, while Lake Janiszew had very low Chl a, typical of an oligotrophic water body. The low N:P ratios (4-6), especially in summer, indicates nitrogen limitation of primary production. There is a risk that such a proportion of the major biogenic elements could lead to harmful cyanobacterial blooms. The lake basins were formed using quaternary deposits (sand, clay) at their bottoms; as a result, the lakes had a slightly alkaline pH (> 8), which favors the development of aquatic organisms. Optimum depth helps establish lake stratification and ensures ecological stability. This applies to post-mining lakes as well; an optimum depth should be determined to ensure the development of thermal stratification, which affects lake processes.

Previous research indicates that the timing and forcing mechanisms of climatic change on the northeastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (NE QTP) are still controversial. Here, we report quartz optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) ages for beach deposits and accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) C-14 age for plant remains, shoreline features and geomorphic exposures that contribute to a reconstruction of the lake-level history of Hurleg Lake on the NE QTP. The results imply that (1) three high lake levels are dated to 6.8-6.4, 5.0-4.7 and 2.2-1.4 kyr, corresponding to relatively wet and stable climate from pollen records of sediment core in this lake during mid-late Holocene; (2) the highest lake-level period occurred at 5.0-4.7 kyr, which is almost synchronous with the highest effective moisture phase from synthesized lake records influenced by the Westerlies and (3) no beach deposits around Hurleg Lake and lower lacustrine deposits in Toson Lake were found during early Holocene, suggesting lower lake level of Hurleg Lake in this period. These results might imply that the Westerlies and local topography rather than Asian summer monsoon dominate the moisture availability in this region during the Holocene.																			0959-6836	1477-0911				MAR	2014	24	3					274	283		10.1177/0959683613517399	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683613517399													WOS:000331373000003

Feeding intensity, as indicated by changes in stomach fullness, increased throughout the day, peaked in late evening, and almost ceased after sunset. Changes in perch densities at the sampling site reflected the pattern of feeding intensity, indicating that movements into the littoral zone are correlated with foraging. Perch diet composition, analyzed as percent occurrence, relative numerical abundance, and percent contribution by weight, differed significantly between times of day, particularly between day and night, and between sampling periods. These differences could be related both to prey behavior and distribution, and to changes in perch foraging behavior in response to light intensity. In terms of biomass, forage fish, amphipods, chironomids, and trichoptera were the most important food items on both sampling dates.																			0378-1909					JUL	1992	34	3					287	303		10.1007/BF00004776	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00004776													WOS:A1992JE17600009
J	Gibson, CE; Anderson, NJ; Haworth, EY				Gibson, CE; Anderson, NJ; Haworth, EY			Aulacoseira suharctica:: taxonomy, physiology, ecology and palaeoecology	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHYCOLOGY												Knowledge of the morphology, taxonomy, physiology, ecology and palaeoecology of the filamentous freshwater diatom Aulacoseira subarctica (O. Muller) Haworth is reviewed from the literature. The species is widely distributed across Northern Europe, Scandinavia and North America, Japan, China, Australia and New Zealand, in the last usually as fo. subborealis. The species is rare in the Tropics and positive identifications are lacking for Africa. The importance of correct identification is stressed because literature reports of its occurrence often need revision. A comparison is made between two sites with detailed records of its seasonal cycle. Bletham Tarn. England, is a clear-water seasonally stratified lake; Lough Neagh, Northern Ireland, is a very large turbid and unstratified lake. In spite of their contrasting characters, Aulacoseira subarctica succeeds in both lakes. In Blelham Tarn. there is a strong seasonal cycle of growth, dormancy on the sediment and further growth on re-suspension. In Lough Neagh, there is a large deposition of cells at the end of the spring bloom but few of these cells survive grazing by benthic animals. Fossil occurrences are summarized from the species' initial appearance in the Pliocene and its later occurrence during the last inter-glacial (Eemian) deposits in NW Europe, where it is an important ecological indicator. Palaeolimnological studies are reviewed to describe the contemporary distribution and ecological preference of this widespread diatom. Aulacoseira subarctica usually appears in response to moderate increases in nutrients but is disadvantaged by further enrichment. In Blelham Tarn the species only became abundant during the twentieth century, reaching a peak between 1930 and 1960. With nutrient enrichment, abundance has declined. In Lough Neagh, it has been present for much of the post-glacial period and still thrives today in spite of the highly enriched state of the take. The species has disappeared from many eutrophic lakes and its sustained existence in Lough Neagh is anomalous. Lough Neagh may continue to offer a favourable habitat in spite of the poor light climate because the water depth, lack of stratification and long water retention time reduce losses to a sustainable level.																			0967-0262					MAY	2003	38	2					83	101		10.1080/0967026031000094102	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0967026031000094102													WOS:000184702900001

The models were applied to 27 Minnesota lake classes, Lake survey data for 3,002 lakes in the Minnesota Lakes Fisheries Database were used as a basis for the classification. The one-dimensional, deterministic, process-based water quality models used 25 years of daily meteorological data (1955-79) as input. The simulated characteristics of daily water temperatures, dissolved oxygen concentrations, and fish habitat during the open water: season are correlated selectively with lake surface area, maximum depth, Secchi depth, annual normal air temperature, and saturated dissolved oxygen concentration. Annual normal air temperature and lake geometry ratio (the fourth root of lake surface area A, divided by the maximum lake depth H-max; A(s)(0.25)/H-max) were found to be good predictors for simulated daily normal (25-year average) surface water temperatures, water temperatures near lake sediments, and volume-averaged wafer temperatures, Saturated dissolved oxygen concentration evaluated at maximum daily normal surface water temperature and take geometry ratio were found to be good predictors for simulated daily normal surface and volume-averaged dissolved oxygen concentrations. Lakes with geometry ratios A(s)(0.25)/H-max > 8 are well mixed, have high dissolved oxygen concentrations, and good fish habitat as long as the upper good growth water temperature limit is not exceeded. Lakes with geometry ratios A(s)(0.25)/H-max < 2 are seasonally stratified, have low dissolved oxygen concentrations near the bottom in summer, and only a fraction of their total lake volume available for good growth of fishes. Empirical formulas for indicators of lake water temperatures, dissolved oxygen, and associated fish habitat as functions of weather and morphometric lake parameters are formulated from the simulation results.																			0733-9496					SEP-OCT	1996	122	5					364	373		10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9496(1996)122:5(364)	http://dx.doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9496(1996)122:5(364)													WOS:A1996VD98300006

The present study investigated the spatiotemporal variability of atmospheric-column-averaged CH4 (XCH4) concentrations using data from the Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT) and the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument on board the Sentinel-5 Precursor (S5P/TROPOMI) from 2009 to 2022 over the south Asian region. During the study period, the long-term trends in XCH4 increased from 1700 to 1950 ppb, with an annual growth rate of 8.76 ppb yr-1. Among all natural and anthropogenic sources of CH4, the rate of increase in XCH4 was higher over the coal site at about 10.15 +/- 0.55 ppb yr-1 (Paschim Bardhaman) followed by Mundra Ultra Mega Power Project at about 9.72 +/- 0.41 ppb yr-1. Most of the wetlands exhibit an annual trend of XCH4 of more than 9.50 ppb yr-1, with a minimum rate of 8.72 +/- 0.3 ppb yr-1 over Wular Lake. The WetCHARTs-based emissions of CH4 from the wetlands were minimal during the winter and pre-monsoon seasons. Maximum CH4 emissions were reported during the monsoon, with a maximum value of 23.62 +/- 3.66 mg m-2 per month over the Sundarbans Wetland. For the 15 Indian agroclimatic zones, significant high emissions of CH4 were observed over the Middle Gangetic Plain, Trans-Gangetic Plain, Upper Gangetic Plain, Eastern Coastal Plains, Lower Gangetic Plain, and East Gangetic Plain. Further, the bottom-up anthropogenic CH4 emissions data are mapped against the XCH4 concentrations, and a high correlation was found in the Indo-Gangetic Plain region, indicating the hotspots of anthropogenic CH4.					; Sagar, Vijay/R-8512-2018; Kumar Sagar, Vijay/R-8512-2018; shaik, ibrahim/NQE-4786-2025; TIWARI, YOGESH/ABB-2247-2020	Pathakoti, Mahesh/0000-0002-1887-9792; Kumar Sagar, Vijay/0000-0002-0863-1240; 													1680-7316	1680-7324				NOV 20	2024	24	22					12843	12859		10.5194/acp-24-12843-2024	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-12843-2024													WOS:001358418800001
J	Koh, T; Sugimoto, T; Matsui, M; Miura, Y				Koh, T; Sugimoto, T; Matsui, M; Miura, Y			Determination of thiosulfate at the 10(-6) M level by its oxidation with iodine in an organic phase and spectrophotometric measurement of triiodide	TALANTA												A highly sensitive method is proposed for the determination of thiosulfate based on the oxidation of aqueous thiosulfate (100 or 200 ml) by iodide in 4 ml of carbon tetrachloride. The excess of iodine was extracted into 8 ml of aqueous iodide solution as triiodide to be measured spectrophotometrically; the thiosulfate could therefore be indirectly highly concentrated and determined selectively. The side-reaction of thiosulfate in a large volume of solution with the hypoiodite formed from the iodine in carbon tetrachloride could be compensated for by adding a certain amount of extra thiosulfate. A linear calibration graph with a negative slope was obtained over the concentration ranges 1.1 x 10(-7)-1 x 10(-5) M (12 ppb-1.12 ppm) for 100 mi of thiosulfate solution and 6 x 10(-8)-5 x 10(-6) M (6.7 ppb-0.56 ppm) for 200 ml of thiosulfate solution. The proposed method was successfully applied to the determination of various amounts of thiosulfate in hot-spring and lake-water samples.

J	Mattheus, CR				Mattheus, C. R.			Foredune-ridge development along an urban pocket beach, Montrose Dunes Natural Area, southwestern Lake Michigan	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												While foredune geomorphology has been studied along many Great Lakes coastlines, little attention has been given to the development and evolution of foredune ridges along engineered 'pocket' beaches, which are common along many urban lakefronts of the region. This paper reports on the recent morphodynamics of Montrose Beach, the largest of Chicago's engineered coastal embayments, with emphasis on its 'Dunes Natural Area.' A post-2020 period of beach recovery occurred after 2013-2020 lake-level rise of >1.5 m, which was accompanied by shoreline recession and overwash-induced backshore accretion. The influx of sand into the urban embayment during this time facilitated post-2020 beach recovery with lake-level fall. This phase of beach expansion was marked by the formation of three distinct, parallel berm lines that have become vegetated and functioned as focal points for eolian accretion. Undisturbed by grooming and other beach-management activities, the Dunes Natural Area continues to be influenced by lake-level changes and storms. Vegetative establishment and eolian sand trapping, upon disconnect from active reworking along the shoreline, have increased the expression of linear topographic highs. Seasonal ridgelines along natural beach environments, including barrier spits, tend to undergo reworking prior to such stabilization. Insights from Montrose Beach provide coastal managers with up-to-date information on important geomorphic developments at Chicago's most popular beach destination, whose Dunes Natural Area provides habitat for the endangered Great Lakes piping plover. Understanding its geomorphic trajectory can help inform coastal resiliency planning, here and elsewhere, to protect valuable ecosystems and infrastructure within the urban coastal landscape.																			0380-1330					AUG	2025	51	4							102449	10.1016/j.jglr.2024.102449	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jglr.2024.102449													WOS:001540922200038

Unique opportunity of an ongoing hydrological reclamation of the open residual pit of the Most mine which significantly exceeds the reclamations being made in the Czech Republic, has been being utilized. The project started in 2011 and is scheduled for 4 years. Significance of air quality changes near a lake caused by microclimate changes of the area of interest is evaluated in a partial project which deals with air quality. Measurement is carried out in two zones and one reference point. Near vicinity of the lake is the first zone where 8 monitoring stations are situated ca 50 - 100 m from the lake bank. Further surroundings are the second zone where 3 monitoring stations are situated ca 50 - 100 m from the lake bank. The reference point is 20 km distant from the locality. The concentrations of characteristic pollutants for this industrial locality are observed - SO2, NOx, O-3, BTX, VOC, H2S, NH3, dust fallout. Samples are taken in a passive way. BTX, VOC and dust fallout sample taking period is 30 days and that of the others is 14 days. Radiello sample taking system is used. In addition to former pollutants a PM10 aerosol particle concentration is continually measured in the second zone and the reference point as well FH62IR beta dust meters are use for these determinations. Partial evaluation of a measurement carried out so far shows a seasonal dependency of results and a dependency of concentration field spatial distribution on monitoring station location and on its distance from significant potential pollutant sources.																			1314-2704						2012							253	260																WOS:000348535300033

However, studies on the linkage between DNRA bacterial community structure and lake eutrophication remain unclear. We examined the community and abundance of DNRA bacteria at six basins of four shallow lakes with different degrees of eutrophication in China. Measurements of the different forms of N and phosphorus (P) in the water column and interstitial water as well as total organic carbon (TOC) and sulfide in the sediments in summer (July 2016) were performed. The nutritional status of Lake Chaohu was more serious than that of the lakes in Wuhan, including Lake Qingling, Lake Houguan, and Lake Zhiyin by comparing geochemical and physical parameters. We found a higher abundance of the nrfA gene, which is a function gene of DNRA bacteria in sediments with higher contents of TOC and sulfide. Moreover, nitrate was a significant factor influencing the DNRA bacterial community structure. A significant difference of the DNRA bacterial community structure between Lake Chaohu and the lakes in Wuhan was discovered. Furthermore, DNRA bacterial abundance and community positively correlated with NH4+ and Chl a concentrations in Lake Chaohu, in which a percent abundance of dominant populations varied along eutrophication gradients. Overall, the abundance and community structure of the DNRA bacteria might be important regulators of eutrophication and cyanobacteria bloom in Lake Chaohu.					yang, liu/GVU-8760-2022; jian, Xiao/HNI-0453-2023; Zhou, Zijun/JBS-6942-2023															2073-4441				JAN	2020	12	1							174	10.3390/w12010174	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w12010174													WOS:000519847200174

Some strains of P. syringae express an ice nucleation protein (hereafter referred to as Ice+) allowing them to catalyze the heterogeneous freezing of water. Though P. syringae has been sampled intensively from freshwater sources in France, little is known about the genetic diversity of P. syringae in natural aquatic habitats in North America. We collected samples of freshwater from three different depths in Claytor Lake, Virginia, USA between November 2015 and June 2016. Samples were plated on non-selective medium (TSA) and on medium selective for Pseudomonas (KBC) and closely related species to estimate the total number of culturable bacteria and of Pseudomonas, respectively. A droplet freezing assay was used to screen colonies for the Ice+ phenotype. Ice+ colonies were then molecularly identified based on the cts (citrate synthase) gene and the 16S rDNA gene. Phylogenetic analysis of cts sequences showed a surprising diversity of phylogenetic subgroups of P. syringae. Frequencies of Ice+ isolates on P. syringae selective medium ranged from 0 to 15% per sample with the highest frequency being found in spring. Our work shows that freshwater lakes can be a significant reservoir of Ice+ P. syringae. Future work is needed to determine the contribution of P. syringae from freshwater lakes to the P. syringae populations present in the atmosphere and on plants and, in particular, if freshwater lakes could be an inoculum source of P. syringae-caused plant disease outbreaks.																			1664-302X					MAR 9	2017	8								318	10.3389/fmicb.2017.00318	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2017.00318								28337177					WOS:000395728000001
J	Huang, C; Yu, LP; Lai, ZP				Huang, Chang; Yu, Lupeng; Lai, Zhongping			Holocene millennial lake-level fluctuations of Lake Nam Co in Tibet using OSL dating of shorelines	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												In the past decades, most Tibetan lakes experienced large-scale rises in response to current global warming, conflicting with the limited amplitudes and gradual fluctuation in shoreline-based lake-levels that occurred over the Holocene. The discrepancy is a critical issue in understanding the regional response to global climate. In this study, we reconstructed the Holocene lake-level variations based on high-resolution luminescence ages of thirtyseven samples from fourteen shorelines of Nam Co in interior Tibet. The findings of this work concluded that Nam Co witnessed millennial large-scale lake-level fluctuations with periodical outflows during 11.9-8.3 ka and a broad decrease thereafter. Seven highstand events with ages of ca. 11.9-11.0, 8.3, 6.7, 5.1, 4.2-3.4, 2.4 and 1.1 ka were identified, consistent with the North Atlantic warmer intervals indicating a quick response to global climatic events. In particular, the dramatic lake-level decline during the transition from the Medieval Warm Period to Little Ice Age demonstrated its potential rapid and sensitive response to millennial climatic changes. Our high-resolution OSL dates enabled detection of millennial-scale highstand events. Based on comparison with other global and regional paleoclimatic records, we suggested that Holocene highstands were mainly attributed to the strengthened monsoonal precipitation and increased glacier meltwater that amplifies lake-level fluctuations of glacier-fed lakes, and that paleoclimate and paleo-lake-level reconstruction by core proxies during lake overflow stages could be problematic.					; yu, lupeng/AAX-5883-2021; Lai, Zhongping/KVB-7935-2024	Huang, Chang/0000-0003-4029-3584; Yu, LuPeng/0000-0002-3014-705X													0022-1694	1879-2707				MAR	2023	618								128643	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2022.128643	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2022.128643		FEB 2023											WOS:000966243600001

Dynamics of water exchange and salt flux in the Macuse Estuary, central Mozambique, southern Africa	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												Studies of water-particle flow dynamics in shallow estuarine systems show that tidal currents control water exchange, salt flux and residence time. We used the 3D Estuary, Lake and Coastal Ocean Model (ELCOM) to estimate the dynamics of tidal currents, salt flux and residence time in the Macuse Estuary, central Mozambique. The model was calibrated using data acquired from field-data measurements obtained in 2014 with an acoustic Doppler current profiler and conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) casts and a tide-gauge. The water flow dynamics that were tracked indicated that tidal currents of 100 cm s(-1) were dissipated by friction caused by bathymetric morphology during both the spring and neap tides. The water dissipation was translated into a phase-difference delay of similar to 15 min between the catchment zone and the outlet during flood and ebb tides. The study showed that tidal currents and river discharges controlled the salt flux (2.07 x 10(5) g kg(-1) m(3) s(-1)) and the variation in residence time from hours to 40 days. The water ages were mostly driven by U-velocity tidal currents, bathymetric gradients and seasonal river discharges of similar to 500 m(3) s(-1). River discharges seasonally affected salinity changes between 15 and 30, and changes in the concentration of suspended sediments of similar to 300 mg l(-1). In addition, it was shown that ELCOM was able to track the water-particle dynamics well, indicating the model's suitability. These results contribute to our understanding of the effect of water-exchange dynamics on residence time and salt flux in shallow coastal inlet systems.					; Miguel, Lucas Lavo Antonio Jimo/JRY-8618-2023; Castro, João/AAR-4444-2021	Miguel, Lucas Lavo Antonio Jimo/0000-0001-6497-9922; 													1814-232X	1814-2338				APR 3	2019	41	2					203	219		10.2989/1814232X.2019.1624276	http://dx.doi.org/10.2989/1814232X.2019.1624276													WOS:000477646700008

Palustrine carbonate in marl prairies precipitates in temporary, barely flooded grasslands within microbial mats. Despite the special mode of carbonate production, descriptions of the sedimentary facies are exceptional and cursory because marl prairies are so far reported only from the recent of the Everglades (Florida, USA), where they produce an unspectacular calcite mud. We present a Pleistocene Everglades-type marl prairie from coastal Tanzania as the first fossil example. The unique preservation and high productivity (two times higher than in the Everglades) of the periphyton community in this marl prairie is due to increased calcification of coccoid and filamentous cyanobacteria. The excellent preservation allows us to characterize a marl prairie facies in great detail for the first time. Facies; analyses of the sediments reveal a transition from tidal to terrestrial settings that started at ca. 44 C-14 ka in response to eustatic sea-level fall and coastal tectonic uplift. The resultant drop of the groundwater table triggered the development of the marl prairie. The decline of the marl prairie was initiated at ca. 33 C-14 ka due to the onset of the Last Glacial Aridity Maximum in equatorial East Africa.					; Reuter, Markus/JWO-6969-2024; Kroh, Andreas/AAI-3650-2020	Harzhauser, Mathias/0000-0002-4471-6655; Reuter, Markus/0000-0003-2988-8368; Berning, Bjorn/0000-0002-0068-9739; Kroh, Andreas/0000-0002-8566-8848; Piller, Werner E./0000-0003-2808-4720													0883-1351	1938-5323				NOV-DEC	2009	24	11-12					747	755		10.2110/palo.2009.p09-062r	http://dx.doi.org/10.2110/palo.2009.p09-062r													WOS:000272511400003

To carry out remote sensing monitoring of water transparency rapidly and intelligently, deep learning technology was used to construct a new retrieval model, namely, point-centered regression convolutional neural network (PSRCNN) suitable for Sentinel 2 and Landsat 8 images. The impact of input feature variables on the accuracy of the inversion model was examined, and the performance of an optimized PSRCNN model was also assessed. This model was applied to remote sensing images of three shallow lakes in the eastern China plain acquired in summer. The PSRCNN model, constructed using five identical bands from Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2 images and 20 band combinations as the input variables, the input window size of 5 x 5 pixels, proves a good predictive ability, with a verification accuracy of R-2 = 0.85, the root mean squared error (RMSE) = 13.0 cm, and the relative predictive deviation (RPD) = 2.58. After the sensitive spectral analysis of water transparency, the band combinations that had correlation coefficients higher than 0.6 were selected as the new input feature variables to construct an optimized PSRCNN model (PSRCNNopt) for water transparency. The PSRCNNopt model has an excellent predictive ability, with a verification accuracy of R-2 = 0.89, RMSE = 11.48 cm, and RPD =3.0. It outperforms the commonly retrieval models (band ratios, random forest, support vector machine, etc.), with higher accuracy and robustness. Spatial variations in water transparency of three lakes from the retrieval results by PSRCNNopt model are consistent with the field observations.

Perennial ice cover on the dry valley lakes decreases the amount of solar radiation reaching the water column, thereby reducing the interaction between the atmosphere and the water column. However, the ice partly shelters the lake ecosystems from the harsh Antarctic climate. Two cores, collected from Lake Hoare in the Taylor Valley in 1995, contained testate rhizopods (mostly Arcella) that have only chitinous organic tests with no agglutinated material, unlike other testate rhizopods that use detrital material to build a test. Additionally, a limited number of possible ostracod carapaces and possible rotifer resting-stage remains were present. The testate rhizopod concentration is generally higher in layers containing abundant bacterial/algal-mat fragments. This reflects the local sedimentation pattern in which layers of alternating mat growth and sediment accumulation on the ice surface subsequently fall to the lake bottom.					; Asioli, Alessandra/ACY-3400-2022	Asioli, Alessandra/0000-0002-2060-4659; 													0096-1191					APR	2014	44	2					177	186		10.2113/gsjfr.44.2.177	http://dx.doi.org/10.2113/gsjfr.44.2.177													WOS:000335208600007

Statistical techniques, such as cluster analysis, can provide a powerful tool for analyzing water chemistry data. This method is used to test water quality data and determine if samples can be grouped into distinct populations that may be significant in the geologic context, as well as from a statistical point of view. Multivariate statistical analysis method is applied to the geochemical data in combination with delta O-18 and delta H-2 isotopes with the objective to understand the dynamics of groundwater using hierarchical clustering and isotope analyses. The geochemical and isotope data of the central and southern rift valley lakes have been collected and analyzed from different works. Isotope analysis shows that most springs and boreholes are recharged by July and August rainfalls. The different hydrochemical groups that resulted from the multivariate analysis are described and correlated with the geology of the area and whether it has any interaction with a system or not.

J	Zaragüeta, M; Acebes, P				Zaragueta, Mikel; Acebes, Pablo			Controlling Eutrophication in A Mediterranean Shallow Reservoir by Phosphorus Loading Reduction: The Need for an Integrated Management Approach	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Increased nutrient enrichment in Mediterranean standing waters has enhanced the risk of being affected by cyanobacterial blooms. Because phosphorus abatement is shaped as a crucial strategy for controlling eutrophication, this study introduces a structural thinking, experiential learning laboratory with animation dynamic model elaborated for Cazalegas Reservoir (Spain) to assess the feasibility of implementing a set of internal and external control measures and hydromorphological adjustments to meet the goal of oligotrophication. This shallow reservoir is another case where recurrent eutrophication has led to reach annual mean total phosphorus concentrations (0.16 +/- 0.08 mg total phosphorus/L) over the threshold of current water policies, triggering cyanobacterial growth up to undesirable levels in summer time (approximately 50,000 cells/mL). Modeling results showed that (i) after upgrading water treatment in the main tributary, (ii) applying a lanthanum-modified bentonite into the water column and sediment, and (iii) increasing reservoir water level, in-lake P concentrations and cyanobacterial abundance decreased in an 88% (below 0.01 mg total phosphorus/L) and 84% (below 6000 cells/mL), respectively in the most critical periods. However, the constraints of the proposed management strategies are associated with their costs of implementation and the time span for a stable trophic recovery of the reservoir. In that end, integrated management approaches are aimed to be adopted by water managers to reach adequate ecological status of freshwater bodies.					; Acebes, Pablo/L-6444-2014	Acebes Vives, Pablo/0000-0003-1880-7841; 													0364-152X	1432-1009				APR	2017	59	4					635	651		10.1007/s00267-016-0815-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00267-016-0815-y								28091740					WOS:000400444400009

Development, implementation, and skill assessment of the NOAA/NOS Great Lakes Operational Forecast System	OCEAN DYNAMICS												The NOAA Great Lakes Operational Forecast System (GLOFS) uses near-real-time atmospheric observations and numerical weather prediction forecast guidance to produce three-dimensional forecasts of water temperature and currents, and two-dimensional forecasts of water levels of the Great Lakes. This system, originally called the Great Lakes forecasting system (GLFS), was developed at The Ohio State University and NOAA's Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory (GLERL) in 1989. In 1996, a workstation version of the GLFS was ported to GLERL to generate semi-operational nowcasts and forecasts daily. In 2004, GLFS went through rigorous skill assessment and was transitioned to the National Ocean Service (NOS) Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services (CO-OPS) in Silver Spring, MD. GLOFS has been making operational nowcasts and forecasts at CO-OPS since September 30, 2005. Hindcast, nowcast, and forecast evaluations using the NOS-developed skill assessment software tool indicated both surface water levels and temperature predictions passed the NOS specified criteria at a majority of the validation locations with relatively low root mean square error (4-8 cm for water levels and 0.5 to 1A degrees C for surface water temperatures). The difficulty of accurately simulating seiches generated by storms (in particular in shallow lakes like Lake Erie) remains a major source of error in water level prediction and should be addressed in future improvements of the forecast system.																			1616-7341					SEP	2011	61	9					1305	1316		10.1007/s10236-011-0424-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10236-011-0424-5													WOS:000294721200006

Carbon sources for lake sturgeon in Lake Winnebago, Wisconsin	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Because lake sturgeon Acipenser fulvescens, like other sturgeon species, are threatened or endangered in many aquatic ecosystems, it is imperative that we increase our understanding of their role in food webs. Our main objective was to determine the carbon sources for lake sturgeon in Lake Winnebago, Wisconsin, which contains one of the largest populations of lake sturgeon in North America. Gut content analysis revealed that gizzard shad Dorosoma cepedianum and Chironomas plumosus larvae (56% and 33% by gut content mass, respectively) were the primary prey items for lake sturgeon in the winter. Larger lake sturgeon were more piscivorous than smaller individuals. A mixing model using delta C-13 and delta N-15 suggests that Chironomus contributes 49% and gizzard shad 37% to the carbon assimilated by lake sturgeon. We estimated the carbon half-life in lake sturgeon to be about 0.6-3.0 years based on a model incorporating metabolism and growth. Thus, the stable isotope results integrate over a considerably longer time period than the gut content analysis. Our results provide critical baseline information about the carbon sources for lake sturgeon that can be used to assess how their role in food webs may change after perturbations such as the introduction of exotic species and changes in land use.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				JUL	2008	137	4					1018	1028		10.1577/T07-214.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/T07-214.1													WOS:000258163500007
J	Martin, BE; Walsh, JR; Vander Zanden, MJ				Martin, Benjamin E.; Walsh, Jake R.; Vander Zanden, M. Jake			Rise of a native apex predator and an invasive zooplankton cause successive ecological regime shifts in a North Temperate Lake	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Ecosystems can undergo abrupt regime shifts as a result of many factors. Shifts between turbid and clearwater states are well understood for human-impacted shallow lakes, but are not well understood in other types of lakes. Here we use long-term data to describe abrupt shifts in water clarity in Trout Lake, an oligotrophic lake with a largely undeveloped watershed. For several decades mean summer water clarity averaged 4.5 m, but then around 2007 water clarity sharply increased and the "clear water regime" persisted for nearly a decade. Nutrient availability did not explain these changes, but rather they were explained by a classic top-down trophic cascade. Around 2007, the population of the apex pelagic predator, Lake Trout, substantially increased. This was accompanied by a sharp decline in the lake's major pelagic prey fish, the zooplanktivorous Cisco. In turn, there was an increase in large-bodied zooplankton taxa (calanoids, Daphnia), which reduced algal biomass. This clear water regime was then disrupted in 2014 by the invasion of a predatory zooplankton, Bythotrephes cederstroemi. This invasion corresponded to strong impacts on lower trophic levels (decrease in large-bodied zooplankton and decreased water clarity), but more minor impacts on higher trophic levels (increased Cisco, decreased Lake Trout abundances)-in effect reversing the trophic cascade and shifting Trout Lake to a novel ecosystem state. Our study provides a long-term, empirically based example of successive ecological regime shifts that occurred from the rise of an apex predator and a mid-trophic level invasion in an undeveloped, oligotrophic lake.

Sulfates dominated the anions and Na, Mg and K the cations of the lakes investigated. Salt concentrations are altered by changes in water volume and construction-induced hydrologic barriers that change the natural water flow and mixing. Hydrologic characteristics of saline lakes dictate the limnological conditions that influence duckling use by controlling salt concentrations, the availability of fresh water and aquatic foods. Ducklings were closely associated with fresh inflow from spring seepages or adjacent wetlands of low salt content. Ducklings that used sheltered bays with chemically stratified water were able to feed on fresh water. Ducklings < 1-3 days of age experienced some mortality at 16 mmho/cm and could not tolerate salt concentrations in prairie lakes that exceeded 20 mmho/cm unless fresh water was also available. Salt concentrations of 17 mmho/cm significantly reduced growth. High levels of Mg and sulfates may cause greater stress on birds than equivalent concentrations of NaCl that are processed by the supraorbital salt glands.																			0022-541X	1937-2817					1984	48	2					340	349		10.2307/3801165	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3801165													WOS:A1984SY25100003

Recognized as a Ramsar site of international importance, Deepor Beel is a biodiverse habitat that supports a variety of flora and fauna, including a rich ichthyofaunal diversity. This research recorded 55 fish species across 9 orders and 21 families, with Cypriniformes and Cyprinidae being the dominant order and family, respectively. Seasonal variations were evident, with the monsoon season exhibiting the highest species richness due to the beel's connectivity with the Brahmaputra River. Environmental factors such as water temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, turbidity and ammonia levels were identified as critical determinants of fish abundance and community structure. The study applied biodiversity indices like Shannon-Wiener, Margalef and Simpson indices to quantify species richness and evenness, highlighting significant diversity fluctuations across seasons. The monsoon and postmonsoon period recorded higher diversity and species richness compared to the winter and premonsoon period. The research also highlights the growing threats to Deepor Beel, including eutrophication, habitat degradation, pollution and the introduction of non-native species. Despite these challenges, the beel remains an important ecological and economic resource, supporting fisheries and local livelihood. The findings underline the necessity for a sustainable management approach, including the implementation of conservation strategies to mitigate anthropogenic disturbances and preserve the ecological integrity of Deepor Beel. The study offers baseline data crucial for guiding future conservation efforts and emphasizes the need for formal management plans to ensure the long-term sustainability of this vital wetland ecosystem.

ARCTIC SCIENCE												Aquatic habitats in the Canadian Arctic are expected to come under increasing stress due to projected effects of climate change. There is a need for community-based biomonitoring programs to observe and understand the effects of these stressors on the environment. Here we present results from a 5 year annual sampling program of benthic invertebrates from lakes in the Mackenzie Delta, Northwest Territories, using a rapid bioassessment protocol. Connectivity between the deltaic lakes and main channels is a major driver of lake function and is expected to be substantially impacted by climate change. Lakes were selected along a gradient of connectivity based on sill elevation above the river. Using multivariate analyses of community structure, we determined that benthic assemblages responded to differences in connection time among lakes. This response was detected using a coarse taxonomic level that could be applied by community groups or volunteers but was stronger when invertebrates were identified to the family and genus levels. A secondary gradient was observed that corresponded to productivity gradients in lakes that are isolated from the river during summer. We show that benthic assemblages have potential use as sensitive indicators of climate-mediated changes to the hydrology of lakes in the Mackenzie Delta.

Information about the sedimentary akinete pool is required to predict blooms of Nostocales. We studied the akinete abundance in the surface sediment of a deep stratified lake in NE Germany to determine which part of the akinete pool is potentially able to germinate under the underwater light, temperature and oxygen conditions present. Akinetes increased in abundance significantly with depth (R-2 = 0.86). They accumulated below 12 m (214 x 10(6) akinetes m(-2)), where temperatures of 8-12A degrees C could support germination, but light supply a <= 0.1 mol photons m(-2) d(-1) and anoxia in the summer prevent germination. Assuming a light supply of 0.5 mol photons m(-2)d(-1) and oxic conditions suitable for germination, only 10% of the total akinete pool deposited in littoral areas of 0-8 m depth can contribute to the recruitment. The sediment area for germination due to oligotrophication would increase from the current 41 to 45-61%. Thus, up to 261 x 10(12) more dormant akinetes could become part of the active akinete pool and consequently influence the future species composition and support the persistence of species.					; Rücker, Jacqueline/H-8994-2019	Rucker, Jacqueline/0000-0001-6841-7724; 													0142-7873	1464-3774				MAY-JUN	2017	39	3					392	403		10.1093/plankt/fbx010	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/fbx010													WOS:000402613800003

Because of the porosity of the lava the waters constantly leak out through the sides and bottom, causing a fairly regular annual fluctuation of the water level of about 14 ft. Silting and the decay of plants are gradually filling it up. In the shallower deeply silted parts is a wide zone of the submerged water moss, Fontinalis, outward from which there is a wide zone of sedge, almost pure Eleocharis palustris. Next follows a zone of willow, Salix sitchensis, with some alder mixed with it at its outer edges. The drier southern shore has a zone of Populus trichocarpa, with a varied undergrowth of herbs and shrubs. In places a narrow indistinct zone of Ranunculus may be noted. As the water level falls the newly exposed areas become covered with a variety of sedges, grasses, and herbs.																			0002-9122	1537-2197				OCT	1931	18	8					641	648		10.2307/2435675	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2435675													WOS:000200486600005

Opportunity Mars Rover mission: Overview and selected results from Purgatory ripple to traverses to Endeavour crater	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS												Opportunity has been traversing the Meridiani plains since 25 January 2004 (sol 1), acquiring numerous observations of the atmosphere, soils, and rocks. This paper provides an overview of key discoveries between sols 511 and 2300, complementing earlier papers covering results from the initial phases of the mission. Key new results include (1) atmospheric argon measurements that demonstrate the importance of atmospheric transport to and from the winter carbon dioxide polar ice caps; (2) observations showing that aeolian ripples covering the plains were generated by easterly winds during an epoch with enhanced Hadley cell circulation; (3) the discovery and characterization of cobbles and boulders that include iron and stony-iron meteorites and Martian impact ejecta; (4) measurements of wall rock strata within Erebus and Victoria craters that provide compelling evidence of formation by aeolian sand deposition, with local reworking within ephemeral lakes; (5) determination that the stratigraphy exposed in the walls of Victoria and Endurance craters show an enrichment of chlorine and depletion of magnesium and sulfur with increasing depth. This result implies that regional-scale aqueous alteration took place before formation of these craters. Most recently, Opportunity has been traversing toward the ancient Endeavour crater. Orbital data show that clay minerals are exposed on its rim. Hydrated sulfate minerals are exposed in plains rocks adjacent to the rim, unlike the surfaces of plains outcrops observed thus far by Opportunity. With continued mechanical health, Opportunity will reach terrains on and around Endeavour's rim that will be markedly different from anything examined to date.					; Chojnacki, Matthew/A-4245-2013; Johnson, Jeffrey/F-3972-2015; Jolliff, Bradley/GOE-3484-2022; Mittlefehldt, David/JUV-2877-2023; Schroder, Christian/B-3870-2009; Schröder, Christian/B-3870-2009; Sullivan, Robert/AAR-8193-2020; Golombek, Matthew/LVS-1918-2024	Johnson, Jeffrey/0000-0002-5586-4901; Chojnacki, Matthew/0000-0001-8497-8994; McLennan, Scott/0000-0003-4259-7178; Schroder, Christian/0000-0002-7935-6039; Rice, Melissa/0000-0002-8370-4139; 													2169-9097	2169-9100				FEB 8	2011	116								E00F15	10.1029/2010JE003746	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2010JE003746													WOS:000287324400001

Species diversity and spatial structure of pelagic zooplankton in a lake of glacial origin during summer stratification	HYDROBIOLOGIA					3rd Symposium on Species in Ancient Lakes	SEP 02-07, 2002	Quincy, WA					Lake South Volos (55 degrees 37' N, 27 degrees 08' E, area 1.2 km(2), max. depth 40.4 m) is a stratificated mesotrophic lake with some features of oligotrophy. From May to September 2000, 54 Rotifera, 11 Copepoda and 17 Cladocera species were recorded in the pelagic zone. A substantional increase in the depth of the thermocline took place from May to July. It was accompanied by a rise in species richness of the zooplankton (Rotifera and Crustacea). Increase in the number of non-overlapping niches was observed with the increase in rotifer species richness. It was shown, that maximum species density was related to temperature, and ecological groups of the species developed in water layers of certain temperatures, though this may not always be indicative of thermopreference. Species dominance in a particular water layer in the column was caused by a combination of factors ("sliced functioning") influencing the zooplankton community. No active diurnal movements between the layers (epi-, meta- and, hypolimnion, and the upper hypolimnion/clinolimnion) were demonstrated by the majority of crustacean species.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				SEP 15	2006	568			1			31	40		10.1007/s10750-006-0337-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-006-0337-3													WOS:000240688900006

High lake levels of Lake Eastern Juyanze were recorded by ostracod assemblages, shell geochemistry and sedimentology between 5.1 and 4.1 cal. ka BP. Relatively humid conditions and a relatively strong influence of the Asian monsoon are indicated by palynological data for the corresponding period. Lake levels decreased afterwards and short-term regressive events occurred at about 4.1, 3.8 and 3.4 cal. ka BP. The overall trend towards lower lake levels culminated in repeated episodes of desiccation of Lake Eastern Juyanze between 3.2 and 2.9 cal. ka BP, in phase with very and conditions inferred from the palynological record. Individual regressive events as well as the rapid environmental fluctuations of Lake Eastern Juyanze at about 3.0 cal. ka BP were regarded as driven by mid to late Holocene summer monsoon fluctuations, supported by the Dunde ice core record.

Inferring parameters of prey switching in a 1 predator-2 prey plankton system with a linear preference tradeoff	JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY												We construct two ordinary-differential-equation models of a predator feeding adaptively on two prey types, and we evaluate the models' ability to fit data on freshwater plankton. We model the predator's switch from one prey to the other in two different ways: (i) smooth switching using a hyperbolic tangent function; and (ii) by incorporating a parameter that changes abruptly across the switching boundary as a system variable that is coupled to the population dynamics. We conduct linear stability analyses, use approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) combined with a population Monte Carlo (PMC) method to fit model parameters, and compare model results quantitatively to data for ciliate predators and their two algal prey groups collected from Lake Constance on the German-Swiss-Austrian border. We show that the two models fit the data well when the smooth transition is steep, supporting the simplifying assumption of a discontinuous prey-switching behavior for this scenario. We thus conclude that prey switching is a possible mechanistic explanation for the observed ciliate-algae dynamics in Lake Constance in spring, but that these data cannot distinguish between the details of prey switching that are encoded in these different models.

Combined effects of temperature and oxygen concentration in the deep water of thermally stratifying lakes seem to be the ultimate factors governing the occurrence of the species throughout its home-territory. E. lacustris is largely restricted to relatively deep lakes (> 30 m) providing a hypolimnetic refuge characterised by low temperatures (<similar to 10 degrees C) and oxygenated water during summer. Therefore, although the species is spread over much of Europe it was only found in a small number of lakes. Long-term records in different lakes revealed E. lacustris to be perennial with relatively high biomasses occurring from May to September. During thermal stratification on average 87% of the nauplii and 72% of the copepodite biomass was found in hypolimnetic waters colder than 10 degrees C. Diurnal vertical migration was observed for the copepodid stages, but the migration amplitude clearly decreased from May to September. The migration amplitude was significantly related to light intensity. According to its special habitat requirements, E. lacustris might be considered a glacial relict sensitive to temperature increase and oxygen depletion.																			1434-2944	1522-2632					2005	90	3					292	309		10.1002/iroh.200410769	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.200410769													WOS:000230200200004

In the last 5-8 years, D. geminata has become established in Boulder Creek and South Boulder Creek, two regulated montane streams in the Front Range of the Colorado Rocky Mountains. Factors that may influence the growth of D. geminata were monitored during the summer of 2006. D. geminata abundance decreased in Boulder Creek after an unusual flood event caused by 3 days of sustained rainfall in the headwaters of the watershed. However, within a week, coverage had been restored to pre-flood levels. Variations in D. geminata abundance among sites were found to be negatively correlated with total dissolved phosphorus concentrations and bed movement, as measured by Shields stress. In contrast, D. geminata abundance was not significantly correlated with temperature, conductivity, pH, total suspended solids, or dissolved inorganic nitrogen. Our results suggest that bed movement may be a dominant scouring mechanism that acts to control the growth and distribution of D. geminata. The potential role of total dissolved phosphorus and bed movement in decreasing D. geminata coverage adds to the limited base of knowledge regarding controls on the growth and distribution of this species, and could be investigated by researchers studying D. geminata blooms in other stream ecosystems.					; Miller, Matthew/A-4928-2016	LIPTZIN, DANIEL/0000-0002-8243-267X; Miller, Matthew/0000-0002-2537-1823; MCKNIGHT, DIANE/0000-0002-4171-1533													0018-8158	1573-5117				SEP	2009	630	1					207	218		10.1007/s10750-009-9793-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-009-9793-x													WOS:000267030500016

Determination of the radiation dose due to radon ingestion and inhalation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												The distribution of radon in ground and surface water samples in Sankey Tank and Mallathahalli Lake areas was determined using Durridge RAD-7 analyzer with RAD H2O accessory. The radiation dose received by an individual falling under different age groups (viz., 3 months; 1, 5, 10, 15 years and adult) depending upon their average annual water consumption rate was attempted. The mean radon activity in surface water of Sankey Tank and Mallathahalli Lake was 7.24 +/- 1.48 and 11.43 +/- 1.11 Bq/L, respectively. The average radon activities ranged from 11.6 +/- 1.7 to 381.2 +/- 2.0 Bq/L and 1.50 +/- 0.83 to 18.9 +/- 1.59 Bq/L, respectively, in 12 groundwater samples each around Sankey Tank and Mallathahalli Lake areas. Majority of the measured groundwater samples (viz., 100 % in Sankey Tank area and 75 % in Mallathahalli Lake area) showed mean radon values above the EPA's maximum contaminant level of 11.1 Bq/L and only 66.67 % of samples in Sankey Tank area showed radon above the WHO and EU's reference level of 100 Bq/L. The overall radiation dose due to radon emanating from water in the study area was increasing with increase in age and water consumption rates, but significantly lower than UNSCEAR and WHO recommended limit of 1 mSv/year except for few groundwater samples in Sankey Tank area (i.e., 0.92, 0.99 and 1.39 mSv/year). The radiation dose rate received by bronchial epithelium via inhalation was very high compared to that by stomach walls via ingestion.

Development of new indices of Great Lakes water quality based on profundal benthic communities	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Benthic invertebrate biomonitoring has long been a tool of choice for assessing the impacts of anthropogenic stress in aquatic systems. The Oligochaete Trophic Index (OTI) is used by the U.S. EPA Great Lakes National Program Office to assess Great Lakes trophic status for State of the Great Lakes reporting under the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement. OTI scores are based on pollution tolerances of ubiquitous profundal oligochaetes. OTI limitations include the fact that the index is based on a limited number of species belonging to a single oligochaete class, species assignment to trophic groups in the index were determined by best professional judgment and cannot be tested independently, and the index's correlation with lake productivity has not been evaluated. To address these concerns, we developed two new indices of Great Lakes water quality based on the OTI equation by: (1) expanding the number of oligochaete species included in the index and reassigning previous classifications of oligochaete species to trophic groups (improved OTI, or iOTI); and (2) adding non-oligochaete species to the OTI (modified Trophic Index, or mTI). Finally, we tested a modeling approach using Modern Analogue Technique (MAT) transfer functions based on species responses to a surface chlorophyll gradient to derive assessment of site trophic status and an independent assignment of species to trophic categories. We found that both iOTI and mTl had a stronger relationship with surface remote-sensed spring chlorophyll than did OTI, but MAT models had stronger correlations with chlorophyll than did any of the indices.

J	ELSER, JJ				ELSER, JJ			PHYTOPLANKTON DYNAMICS AND THE ROLE OF GRAZERS IN CASTLE LAKE, CALIFORNIA	ECOLOGY												During summer 1987, a series of experiments was performed in conjunction with monitoring of in situ plankton dynamics in nutrient-deficient Castle Lake, California. These factorial manipulations of nutrients and zooplankton were designed to separate the direct (grazing mortality) and indirect (stimulation of algal growth by nutrient recycling) effects of grazers on both species-specific phytoplankton dynamics, as well as aggregate properties such as total biomass, productivity, and biomass turnover. Grazing loss rates differed significantly among algal species with the mean grazing loss rate suffered by an algal species a negative function of cell or colony size. Stimulation of division rates in the presence of zooplankton (compared to an unenriched treatment lacking zooplankton) was commonly observed. Nutrient and grazer treatments also had significant impacts on algal biomass (indicated by chlorophyll concentration), productivity (PPR), and PPR/chlorophyll, and significant nutrient-grazer interactions were frequently observed. Species-specific algal responses to grazers were aggregated across the phytoplankton by weighting species-specific parameters by the contribution of each species to total community biomass in order to provide community-wide estimates of the importance of direct and indirect effects on algal dynamics. Finally, linkages between population-level responses and aggregate properties were demonstrated by examining relationships between total phytoplankton biovolume concentration and chlorophyll concentration in various treatments, by comparing community-wide grazing rates estimated from aggregated species-specific grazing rates and from changes in chlorophyll growth rates, and by relating the aggregated degree of species-specific growth stimulation to stimulation of biomass turnover. These results indicate that phytoplankton responses to grazers in Castle Lake reflect a mix of direct and indirect effects that varies considerably both between species and through time during the stratified season.

The Middle to Late Pleistocene age is established on the basis of lithostratigraphy and confirmed by two thermoluminescence age determinations at the top of the section. The ostracod assemblages show that the lake water remained fresh or, at most, was very slightly saline, throughout the period represented by the section. Nearly all ostracod taxa identified from the sediments are cold stenothermal forms and they include inhabitants of the littoral and profundal domain as well as running waters and springs, The Ostracoda present within the section indicate that during deposition of the upper Karewa sediments a large, but fairly shallow, well-oxygenated open-basin freshwater lake existed in that central part of the Kashmir Basin, Although the sequences Suggest changes in water depth may have occurred, lacustrine conditions were otherwise largely unchanged over the period represented by the section, LIP until the demise of the lake during the early part of the Late Pleistocene.

Changes in glacier extent in the eastern Pamir, Central Asia, determined from historical data and ASTER imagery	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Historical surveys and recent satellite imagery are used to map and assess glacier recession in the eastern Pamir over the last three decades. For this study we used topographic maps of 1 : 100000 scales published in 1943 and 1970; air photos from 1978 and 1990; space images: from Russian satellites in 1972, 1978, 1980, and 1990 and ASTER data for 2001. Climatic records from the "Fedtchenko" glacier station (4156 m a.s.l., 38.83 degrees N, 72.22 degrees E) and "Murgab" meteorological station (3576 m a.s.l., 38.17 degrees N, 73.97 degrees E) are used for analysis of the climate conditions in the region. Changes in the area of 5 glaciers and terminus positions of 44 glaciers in the eastern Pamir reveal an accelerating trend since the end of the 1970s through 2001, as a continuation of glacier wastage and retreat since, at least, the end of the Little Ice Age. The glacier area decreased 7.8% during 1978-1990, and 11.6% in 1990-2001. This corresponds with documented changes in other mountain and subpolar regions in the Northern Hemisphere and specifically in Central Asia. Glacier changes in the eastern Pamir are a response to increasing summer temperatures. We find decreases in glacier area and retreat of glacier fronts, increased debris-covered area and the appearance of new lakes. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Morgan and its variant Buggy Creek virus were made front swallow bugs, Oeciacus vicarius Horvath (Hemiptera: Cimicidae), collected from cliff swallow (Petrochelidon pyrrhonota) nests Lit the Stone Lakes National Wildlife Refuge, Sacramento County, CA, during the summers of 2005 and 2006. This virus (hereafter Stone Lakes virus, family Togaviridae, genus Alphavirus, STLV) was the first record of this viral group west of the Continental Divide. STLV replicated well in Vero and other vertebrate cell cultures but failed to replicate in C6/36 cells or infect Culex tarsalis Coquillett mosquitoes. STLV failed to produce elevated viremias in adult chickens or house sparrows and was weakly immunogenic. In addition, STLV was not isolated from cliff swallow nestlings nor was antibody detected in adults collected at mist nets. We suggest that STL and related swallow bug viruses may be primarily infections of cimicids that are maintained and amplified either by vertical or nonviremic transmission and that cliff swallows may primarily be important as a bloodmeal source for the bugs rather than Lis an amplification host for the viruses.

The analysis was based on bathymetric measurements carried out in 2018 and cartographic materials, and performed using QGIS 3.10 and SAGA GIS 6.4 software. Moreover, changes in physical (temperature, transparency), chemical (dissolved oxygen, phosphorus, and nitrogen content) and biological (chlorophyll a, phytoplankton) parameters were analysed based on the results of measurements conducted by the Voivodeship Inspectorate of Environment Protection (VIEP) in Bydgoszcz in the period 1984-2017. It was found that Lake Borowno is subject to a constant reduction in surface area and volume, the rate of which increased in the second decade of the 21st century. The lake's progressive disappearance results from the co-occurrence of hydrological drought over the last several years and an increase in the use of groundwater resources. A decrease in the maximum depth of the lake entails a change in temperature distribution in the vertical profile, which contributes to the tendency toward the lake transforming into an unstratified reservoir. The increase in water temperature affects oxygen content in the bottom water, improves water transparency, and influences the maximum occurrence of chlorophyll a in spring.					; Szumińska, Danuta/AAM-5133-2020; Czapiewski, Sebastian/GZH-1035-2022	Szuminska, Danuta/0000-0001-7142-9080; Czapiewski, Sebastian/0000-0001-8010-1378; 														2073-4441				MAY	2020	12	5							1348	10.3390/w12051348	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w12051348													WOS:000555915200127

From River to Lake: Phosphorus partitioning and algal community compositional changes in Western Lake Erie	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The Maumee River is an important source of phosphorus (P) loading to western Lake Erie and potentially a source of Microcystis seed colonies contributing to the development of harmful algal blooms in the lake. Herein, we quantified P forms and size fractions, and phytoplankton community composition in the river-lake coupled ecosystem before (June), during (August), and after (September) a large Microcystis bloom in 2009. Additionally, we determined the distribution and density of a newly emergent cyanobacterium, Lyngbya wollei, near Maumee Bay to estimate potential P sequestration. In June, dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP) was the most abundant P form whereas particulate P (partP) was most abundant in August and September. Green algae dominated in June (44% and 60% of total chlorophyll in river and lake, respectively) with substantial Microcystis (17%) present only in the river. Conversely, in August, Microcystis declined in the river (3%) but dominated (32%) the lake. Lake phytoplankton sequestered <6% of water column P even during peak Micro cystis blooms; in all lake samples <112 mu m non-algal particles dominated partP. Lyngbya density averaged 19.4 g dry wt/m(2), with average Lyngbya P content of 15% (to 75% maximum) of water column P. The presence of Microcystis in the river before appearing in the lake indicates that the river is a potential source of Microcystis seed colonies for later lake blooms, that DOP is an important component of early summer total P, and that L wollei blooms have the potential to increase P retention in nearshore areas.

J	Lange, D				Lange, Dierk			Sao Traditions of Makari South of Lake Chad Transcontinental Projections of Assyro-Babylonian History	ANTHROPOS												The present study tries to solve the enigma of the legendary Sao on the basis of the traditions of the city-state of Makari south of Lake Chad. It analyses the town's king list, its oral traditions and its ritual heritage in the light of the Assyrian hypothesis (put forward by the author in several publications). It suggests that Makari's ancient traditions correspond to extensive transcontinental projections which underwent important transformations by processes of localization. By resetting the traditions in their original Mespotamian context, it shows that the Sao were the Neo-Assyrian conquerors of vast regions of the ancient Near East. After the destruction of Nineveh by the Babylonian insurgent Nabopolassar in 612 B.C. and the subsequent fall of the Assyrian Empire, some of the formerly resettled deportees fled to the region south of Lake Chad where they founded the city-state of Makari. Their desacralized traditions bear witness to the former prestige accorded to the Sao-Assyrians.																			0257-9774						2021	116	1					111	136		10.5771/0257-9774-2021-1-111	http://dx.doi.org/10.5771/0257-9774-2021-1-111													WOS:000652826200009

At the Experimental Lakes Area in northwestern Ontario, Canada, a long-term, whole-lake experiment was conducted using a before-after-control-impact design to determine both direct and indirect effects of the synthetic oestrogen used in the birth control pill, 17 alpha-ethynyloestradiol (EE2). Algal, microbial, zooplankton and benthic invertebrate communities showed no declines in abundance during three summers of EE2 additions (5-6 ng l(-1)), indicating no direct toxic effects. Recruitment of fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) failed, leading to a near-extirpation of this species both 2 years during (young-of-year, YOY) and 2 years following (adults and YOY) EE2 additions. Body condition of male lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) and male and female white sucker (Catostomus commersonii) declined before changes in prey abundance, suggesting direct effects of EE2 on this endpoint. Evidence of indirect effects of EE2 was also observed. Increases in zooplankton, Chaoborus, and emerging insects were observed after 2 or 3 years of EE2 additions, strongly suggesting indirect effects mediated through the reduced abundance of several small-bodied fishes. Biomass of top predator lake trout declined by 23-42% during and after EE2 additions, most probably an indirect effect from the loss of its prey species, the fathead minnow and slimy sculpin (Cottus cognatus). Our results demonstrate that small-scale studies focusing solely on direct effects are likely to underestimate the true environmental impacts of oestrogens in municipal wastewaters and provide further evidence of the value of whole-ecosystem experiments for understanding indirect effects of EDCs and other aquatic stressors.

Following this, one might therefore expect that the likelihood that a small songbird species would nest on a given island in a large freshwater lake would similarly be a function of island size and distance to the mainland. We tested this by installing a single nest box on each of 37 islands in Lake Norman, North Carolina, in the fall of 2019. We hypothesized that Carolina Chickadees (Poecile carolinensis) would be more likely to nest in boxes on islands that are large and/or close to the mainland. Combining our results from 2020 and 2021, we found that neither island size, distance to the mainland, nor an interaction between the two explained the presence of breeding chickadees on islands.

China's transboundary waters: new paradigms for water and ecological security through applied ecology	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. China is Asia's most important upstream riparian country, sharing 110 rivers and lakes with 18 downstream countries. Consequently, China's management of transboundary water resources must consider both environmental and geopolitical risks. 2. The major threats to and conflicts over international rivers in China revolve around biotic homogenisation due to the installation of transport links, water allocation, water pollution, alteration of natural flow patterns and disruption of fisheries due to the installation of hydropower dams, and droughts and floods exacerbated by climate change. Because these problems have an international component, they fall under China's Peaceful Rise strategy, mandating that transboundary conflicts be resolved amicably as part of the overarching goal of increasing regional economic growth with as little conflict as possible. 3. Science-backed policy is more likely to result in long term, mutually agreeable solutions; the results of applied ecological research have already resulted in a number of mitigation measures, including setting operational thresholds to reduce the downstream impact of dams, designating protected areas along key river stretches where dams cannot be installed (one dam in a critical location has been cancelled), and the installation of terrestrial protected-area networks. 4. Synthesis and applications. Applied ecology will continue to play an important role in the diagnosis and resolution of environmental threats to China's transboundary waters. More importantly, applied ecology can inform the development of a transboundary environmental compensation mechanism and regional consultative mechanisms that support informed, cooperative decision-making for China and its riparian neighbours.

The analysis should help in the interpretation of the region's fossil pollen records. Thirty surface soil samples were collected along a southeast-northwest transect in Dobrogea, in a low plateau region separating the Razelm and Sinoie Lakes, near the Danube Delta. Numerical analysis of the surface samples revealed four palynologically distinct assemblages: coastal steppe, delta-marshland, forest-steppe and forest. A mixture of low rainfall and strong maritime winds, with high inputs of salty spin-drifts, explains the steppe-like vegetation of the low coastal areas. Increasing inland moisture along the slopes controls the progressive gradient from wooded to forested areas. Human impact is nowadays of secondary importance in northern Dobrogea, due to a fall in agriculture pressures since the breakup of socialism in Eastern Europe. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Such treatments are being applied in aquatic-adjacent forests that provide a critical habitat for sensitive amphibians, yet little is known about the impact of these treatments. We used a 5-year (2017-2021) before-after-control-impact experiment to investigate the effects of hand-thinning on pond-breeding amphibian activity around an ephemeral lake in the southern Cascade Range of California. We found that hand-thinning had no detectable negative effects on long-toed salamanders (Ambystoma macrodactylum) and western toads (Anaxyrus boreas) and significantly increased adult Sierran chorus frog (Pseudacris sierra) activity (chi 2 = 4.70, df = 1, p = 0.030) in upland habitats. These results are consistent with pre-treatment habitat associations-chorus frog activity was higher when tree density was lower, and the treatment reduced tree density; adult long-toed salamanders and western toads were positively associated with canopy closure, which was not significantly reduced by the treatment. In addition, late-season surface activity of adult long-toed salamanders and chorus frogs was strongly associated with fall rain events when they tend to cluster very near the lake edge. Hand-thinning in aquatic-adjacent habitat may have minimal negative impacts, and even some positive impacts, on pond-breeding amphibians in coniferous forests, especially if treatments are not implemented during periods of high amphibian activity and do not substantially alter canopy closure.

J	Callender, E; Granina, L				Callender, E; Granina, L			Geochemical mass balances of major elements in Lake Baikal	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Major element mass balances for Lake Baikal are calculated with mostly previously published data for soluble fluxes and new, unpublished data for riverine suspended particulate matter chemistry. Physical transport seems to be the most important riverine process. The elements Ca, Mg, and Na seem to be very mobile in the weathering mantle and K and Si seem to be relatively mobile. A comparison of elemental input-output budgets and mass accumulation rates (MAR) in bottom sediments shows that most major elements, except Ca, Si, and Mn, have comparable riverine particulate matter fluxes and MARs. The addition of wet atmospheric deposition fluxes results in an excess of Ca, Mg, and Na entering the lake. The additive effect of these excess inputs during a 40-year period amounts to undetectable concentration increases in the water column. If erosion of weathered bedrock is the source of most dissolved and all particulate matter transported to the lake, theoretical elemental fluxes can be calculated with Al as the conservative element. Flux ratios (observed/theoretical) range from 0.7 to 2.2, but most fall within the acceptable range of 0.7-1.5. Major rock-forming elements are carried by rivers as weathering products and there are minimal biogeochemical processes that modify these inputs as suspended particulate matter accumulates in the bottom sediments of the lake.																			0024-3590					JAN	1997	42	1					148	155		10.4319/lo.1997.42.1.0148	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1997.42.1.0148													WOS:A1997XK60100015

W12512	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												The absorption and scattering coefficients in the euphotic zone of oligotrophic Lake Taupo, New Zealand, were measured at 19 stations across the 620 km(2) lake in late fall during the period of mixed layer deepening and development of the annual phytoplankton maximum. These coefficients were subsequently related to the water content of colored dissolved organic matter ( CDOM), phytoplankton, and nonalgal particles via measurements of the absorption spectra of these optically active substances and of chlorophyll a and suspended particle concentrations. Measurements of the spectral diffuse attenuation coefficient for downwelling irradiance (K-d) and of reflectance (L-u/E-d) revealed that the clear blue waters of Lake Taupo had a minimum K-d of 0.09 m(-1) at 500 nm and maximum reflectance at 490 nm. The measured K-d and L-u/E-d were well described by modeled spectra that were computed using a radiative transfer model (Hydrolight) assuming relatively low values for the backscattering ratio (0.008-0.014). The relationships established here between the optical properties and optically active substances were consistent with previous observations in case 2 marine waters, and they will provide a basis for prediction of eutrophication, climate, and other environmental effects on the blueness and transparency of large oligotrophic lakes.					; Vincent, Warwick/AAH-6152-2019	Vincent, Warwick/0000-0001-9055-1938; Belzile, Claude/0000-0003-3908-7433; Howard-Williams, Clive/0000-0002-8323-6806; Hawes, Ian/0000-0003-2471-6903													0043-1397	1944-7973				DEC 18	2004	40	12							W12512	10.1029/2004WR003090	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2004WR003090													WOS:000225885500002

Effect of Brood Reduction on Nest Abandonment of Smallmouth Bass	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Smallmouth bass Micropterus dolomieu are well known for vigilantly guarding their nests, which is done solely by the males. Because parental care is costly, smallmouth bass are faced with a trade-off between current and future reproduction. If the male foregoes current reproductive efforts and abandons his nest, he may be better able to prepare for future efforts. In this article, we present field data on the effect of brood reduction on nest abandonment and explore the role of male age, brood size, and brood age on nest abandonment. We removed 0, 25, 50, or 75% of the brood from males' nests in Lake Opeongo, Ontario, during the summers of 2007 and 2008 and observed the response (nest success or failure). Across all treatments, 22 of 105 nests (21%) failed and were abandoned, but there was no significant difference among treatments. However, fish that abandoned their nests were significantly younger and had fewer offspring at the time of abandonment than did those that did not. In addition, younger nests were more likely to be abandoned than older nests. Our results differ from those of previous brood reduction experiments, although they match parental care theory overall.

Diagnostic Test Results and Pathology Associated with the 2007 Canadian H7N3 Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Outbreak	AVIAN DISEASES					7th International Symposium on Avian Influenza	APR 05-08, 2009	Univ Georgia, Athens, GA		Univ Georgia			In September 2007, an H7N3 highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreak (HPAI) occurred on a multiple-age broiler breeder operation near Regina Beach, Saskatchewan, Canada. Mortality was initially observed in a barn that housed 24-wk-old roosters, with later involvement of 32-wk-old breeders. All birds on the affected premises were destroyed, and surveillance of surrounding farms demonstrated no further spread. The use of water from a dugout pond during periods of high demand, and the proximity of the farm to Last Mountain Lake, the northern end of which is a bird sanctuary, implicated wild aquatic birds as a possible source of the virus. Of particular note, the H7-specific real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay that was in use at the time did not detect the virus associated with this outbreak. A Canadian national influenza A virus survey of wild aquatic birds detected no H7 subtype viruses in 2005 and 2006; however, H7 subtype viruses were detected in the fall of 2007. Phylogenetic analysis of a number of these H7 isolates demonstrated an evolutionary relationship with each other, as well as with the H7N3 HPAI virus that was isolated from the Saskatchewan broiler breeder farm.																			0005-2086	1938-4351				MAR	2010	54	1		S			213	219		10.1637/8822-040209-Reg.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1637/8822-040209-Reg.1								20521634					WOS:000276455300008
J	Manca, M; Comoli, P				Manca, M; Comoli, P			Reconstructing long-term changes in Daphnia's body size from subfossil remains in sediments of a small lake in the Himalayas	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												A combined analysis of modern zooplankton and fossil Cladocera assemblages from a Himalayan lake, Lake 40, revealed that the endemic Daphnia tibetana disappeared in the late-1980s, after persisting as the only Daphnia species for almost 3000 years. Daphnia head shields, which are rarely recovered from the sediments, were the most abundant Daphnia remains in the lake. The remains were of the Ctenodaphnia type; the smaller ones had a large central hole. Head shields of the same type were also found in zooplankton water samples, rich in exuviae as well as of intact specimens of D. tibetana, from a nearby lake. Small individuals had a distinct nuchal organ in the dorsal region of the head. We therefore postulated that the head shields with the hole were from young (newborn or individuals in the two first moults). Up to now, the nuchal organ has been described in laboratory populations of D. (Ctenodaphnia) magna, where it disappears quite early in life. It probably functions as an osmoregulatory organ, essential for the survivorship of late embryos and early juveniles. On the other hand, as far as we know, head shields with a hole have never been recorded in plankton or in sediments. In view of the fact that head shields were representative of Daphnia abundance, we used them to reconstruct changes in density and body size during ca. 3000 years. In fishless mountain lakes, mean Daphnia body size tends to increase toward the end of the productive season. The number of moults and maximum body size depend mainly on the duration of the ice-free period, and on summer temperatures. In cold years, when the productive season is short, the number of moults will be low, and the range of Daphnia body size will be narrow. We used Daphnia body size and abundance estimates, in addition to an analysis of changes in the Cladocera assemblage, to reconstruct past environmental conditions.

Paraglacial processes are the governing mechanism of landscape evolution in deglaciating valleys and are now studied to understand the deglacial and postglacial landscape dynamics. We here present and describe detailed glacial geomorphology of Lashar and Chopta valleys as the area is strongly modified by the erosional and depositional imprints of late Pleistocene glaciations (MIS 2). Using geomorphological and stratigraphical methods, field surveys, SRTM DEM, Landsat ETM+and Google Earth Pro data, we have mapped glacial and glaciofluvial landforms and established moraine stratigraphy in the study area. Based on the morphostratigraphical mapping of the moraines supported by limited optical chronology, four events of glaciations have been identified in the in the Lashar, Chopta and Kalip valleys and date back to last glacial maximum and advocate for a widespread ice cover with large outlet tributary glaciers. The disposition of the lateral and terminal moraines has been used to estimate the area of paleoglacial extent and their corresponding ice volume during different stages. The presence of proglacial lakes, sensitive indicators of climate change, suggests that the glaciers in the region are melting and radically responding to global warming and are potentially vulnerable for generating glacial lake outburst floods.					ali, sheikh'nawaz/NRY-7735-2025; SHARMA, ANUPAM/AAK-7338-2020; Singh, Rupendra/W-5825-2019; Sharma, Radha/AAF-6007-2020	Sharma, Dr. R.

Vertical distribution of Lake Superior cisco ( Coregonus artedi) spawning aggregations and implications for population monitoring	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Cisco ( Coregonus artedi) support an evolving commercial roe fishery in Wisconsin waters of Lake Superior. To monitor trends in spawning cisco abundance, fishery managers recently began estimating adult biomass and exploitation using fall hydroacoustic surveys, which were combined with gill net surveys to inform apportionments of acoustic data. The gill net survey design consisted of paired top-suspended and bottom-set gill nets, but only the sex ratios from top nets are currently used with the hydroacoustic surveys due to an assumption that cisco in Lake Superior are pelagic spawners. However, the vertical sex distribution of cisco during spawning aggregations has been described as dynamic, with males becoming more bottom-oriented throughout the spawning season. We used multilevel aggregated binomial regressions to: 1) determine if there is bias between top and bottom gill net catches of cisco for either sex and if it changes throughout the spawning season, 2) evaluate how the vertical distribution of males and females may create bias in sex ratios used to estimate exploitation, and 3) explore the effect that maturity (i.e., gonadal development) has on vertical distribution during spawning aggregations. We identified sex-specific bias in vertical catch location that has the potential to bias estimates of sex ratio, and the source of this bias may be attributable to maturity driven changes in behavior. These findings highlight a need for caution when relying on gill nets to apportion cisco sex ratios during spawning aggregations and provide support for a non-pelagic alternative hypothesis of spawning behavior.																			0380-1330					FEB	2025	51	1							102424	10.1016/j.jglr.2024.102424	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jglr.2024.102424		JAN 2025											WOS:001409709000001

However, our knowledge of snow cover in Arctic regions is very limited due to the sparseness of in situ measurements. This study presents a new method to derive snow accumulation information for Arctic regions through tracking the surface elevation changes of numerous frozen arctic lakes measured by Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation satellite (ICESat) repeat altimetry observations. The original ICESat elevation product for continental surface was generated by tracking the centroids of the emitted and the returned laser waveforms. This product contains many biased measurements over frozen arctic lake surfaces due to the scattering effects induced by thin clouds and blowing snow. This study derives an operational approach that produces more reliable altimetry observations by converting the elevation measurements from the centroid scheme to the max-amplitude-peak scheme. Time-variable biases exist between the repeat elevation measurements acquired in different ICESat campaigns. The correction of these inter-campaign biases in this study significantly improves the quantification of the surface elevation change, thus enabling more consistent subsequent snow accumulation estimates. Besides snow fall, lake ice growth also contributes to the surface elevation change. We developed a method to measure and remove this contribution from the total lake surface elevation change, which leads to more accurate estimates of snow accumulation on frozen surfaces of 277 lakes in Arctic regions of northern Alaska. The results were validated using in situ snow depth observations from terrestrial stations on the Arctic coastal plain of Alaska. After the correction of the ICESat inter-campaign biases and the removal of contribution by lake surface phase transformation, the snow accumulation derived from the repeat ICESat elevation measurements are highly correlated with in situ snow depth observations with a Pearson's correlation coefficient r of 0.88. In comparison with ground-based measurements, the root mean square error (RMSE) of our snow accumulation estimates is approximately 5 cm. Our method makes it possible to provide much denser snow accumulation information as compared to the existing in situ observations for the Circum-Arctic coastal regions and also the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau where seasonal frozen lakes are abundant.

An environmental audit over a 16-month period developed quantitative limnological data required by regulatory agencies. The deep quarry basin, protected by high sandstone walls, became strongly stratified in summer. Development of littoral vegetation in the quarry was prevented by the steep sides of the basin. Unusual characteristics of the man-made quarry basin, compared to most natural lakes in Connecticut, included a mean depth of 14 m, an intense thermocline, and negative heterograde oxygen profiles with metalimnetic minima. Alkalinity, conductivity, and nutrient levels differed significantly between the quarry and the river. Mean chlorophyll a concentrations in the two systems were similar, but the distribution of phytoplankton classes were quite different. The environmental audit, by comparing physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of the quarry to those of the river, allowed prediction of changes in trophic status when the two systems are joined.

Measurements of peat depth, active-layer depth, and distributions of ground-ice features are reported here for a 4400 y peatland chronosequence in swales of the Espenberg beach-ridge plain, NW Alaska, with swale ages constrained by 55 radiocarbon assays. Permafrost aggrades to 1.5 m deep within 500 years after swales are isolated from the sea. Continuous peat layers form by 600 y, followed by initially rapid and then slower rates of peat accumulation, reaching depths of 1.2 m by 1500 y but only 1.9 in at 4400 y. Frost blisters occur in peatlands 600-1200 y old, where peat does not extend the full depth of the active layer, facilitating injection of water under hydrostatic pressure through unfrozen sand during early winter. Palsas and peat ridges first occur in large numbers after approximately 1200 y and persist thereafter. Peat ridges at Espenberg are sinuous, elongate palsas whose planform and initiation is attributed to cooling-induced tension fractures.																					90-5809-582-7				2003							901	906																WOS:000185049300158

A similar to 2.20-meter deep sedimentary profile obtained near the Chandra Shekhar Azad bird sanctuary (Nawabganj lake-NL) of the CGP was studied to understand the evolution of the ecosystem and climate using pollen/spores, diatoms, testate amoebae, environmental magnetic data,and carbon and nitrogen isotopes. This sedimentary profile is chronologically well-constrained by five radiocarbon (C-14) dates. Between 4.6 and 4.4 ka, the sandy sediment and pollen evidence for riparian forest, the absence of aquatic pollen and sponge spicules suggest scant water in the vicinity through the river channel. A semi-closed fluvial ecosystem between 4.4 and 4.2 ka is indicated by testate amoebae, sponge spicules and arboreal pollen. At least two intermittent warm conditions prevailed between 4.6 and 4.2 ka. Between 4.2 and 2.8 ka, high aquatic pollen, diatoms and testate amoebae indicate a lake ecosystem. By v2.8-0.9 ka the gammoscleres from sponges formed during dry seasons indicate recharging during monsoon as the river shifted. Thereafter, agricultural pollen (Brassica and Apiaceae) indicates a further shift in the lake boundary exposing land. The highly sandy texture, fluctuating delta C-13, delta N-15 and magnetic mineral values indicate an unstable fluvio-lacustrine deposition inducing hydroecological changes influenced by intermittent about 5-6 humid and dry climatic conditions since similar to 4.6 ka to present. The calcrete layer in the bottom sediments shows high aridity in CGP between similar to 5 and 4.6 ka reaching the climax cold-dry event of similar to 4.2 ka recorded worldwide. The spectral analysis of palynological data from NL and the contemporary Barela Lake, reveals de Vries and Gleissberg cycles of low and high solar irradiance at centennial to multi-centennial scale during the Holocene. The impact on vegetation, sediment depositional dynamics, and shift in river channel was more rapid showing the dominance of similar to 200 years. periodicity post similar to 5 ka as compared to similar to 300 years of dominance prior to this. This centennial timescale is of great speculation for future climate predictions in CGP coupled with the anthropogenic forcings.					; Shukla, Sunil/GLR-0323-2022; Khan, Salman/KBD-0038-2024	Khan, Salman/0000-0003-0608-173X; Phartiyal, Binita/0000-0003-3086-8735; Shukla, Sunil/0000-0002-7517-5564; 													0959-6836	1477-0911				OCT	2023	33	10					1272	1288		10.1177/09596836231183067	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/09596836231183067		JUL 2023											WOS:001034257100001

The objective of this study was to describe the first finding of S. balatonis in Serbia in Lake Savsko and to update information on the distribution and ecology of this rare species. Periphyton samples were collected from artificial substrates incubated at three depths (0.5 m, 0.8 m and 1.4 m) in Lake Savsko and the epilithic community was sampled in the littoral zone. Samples were collected weekly in summer 2014, from mid-July to mid-September. Diatom permanent slides were prepared and small numbers of S. balatonis specimens were observed only in samples collected in September from artificial substrates incubated at the greatest depth (1.4 m). Our results significantly contribute to the information on the contemporary distribution and the ecology of this rare diatom taxon, especially considering the fact that S. balatonis specimens were observed in our study in diatom communities developed on artificial substrates and in an urban reservoir, i.e. Lake Savsko.

Samples of water, sediment and benthos were taken from three reaches located in the upstream, middle stream and downstream respectively during March-April 2010. Parameters characterizing flow, chemical and biological conditions were analyzed for each sample. In total, 31 species of 6 classes were identified, including Insecta (13 species), Gastropoda (8 species), Lamellibranchiata (3 species), Crustacea (3 species), Oligochaeta (2 species) and Hirudinea (2 species). The density ranged from 20 ind./m(2) to 3780 ind./m(2) with an average of 750 ind./m(2). The macrofauna composition was Gastropoda (48.0%), Insecta (23.9%), Lamellibranchia (14.9%) and the others (13.2%). The biomass ranged from 0.9 g/m(2) to 1001.6 g/m(2) with an average of 150.8 g/m(2). The macrofauna composition was Gastropoda (70.5%), Lamellibranchia (24.7%) and the others (4.8%). Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) revealed that species distributions were mainly governed by flow velocity, conductivity, chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total nitrogen.

Coherent changes in relative C4 plant productivity and climate during the late Quaternary in the North American Great Plains	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Evolution of the mixed and shortgrass prairie of the North American Great Plains is Poorly understood because of limited proxies available for environmental interpretations. Buried soils in the Great Plains provide a solution to the problem because they are widespread both spatially and temporally with their organic reservoirs serving as a link to the plants than once grew on them. Through stable carbon isotopic analysis of soil organic carbon (delta C-13), the percent carbon from C-4 plants (%C-4) can be ascertained. Because C-4 plants are primarily warm season grasses responding positively to summer temperature, their representation has the added advantage of serving as a climate indicator. To better understand grassland and climate dynamics in the Great Plains during the last 12 ka (ka = 1000 radiocarbon years) we developed an isotopic standardization technique by: determining the difference in buried soil delta C-13 and modern Soil delta C-13 expected for that latitude (Delta delta C-13), and transferring the Delta delta C-13 to Delta%C-4 (% C-4) using mass balance calculations. Our analysis reveals two isotopic stages in the mixed and shortgrass prairie of the Great Plains based on trends in Delta%C-4. In response to orbital forcing mechanisms, Delta%C-4 Was persistently below modern in the Great Plains between 12 and 6.7 ka (isotopic stage 11) evidently because of the cooling effect of the Laurentide ice sheet and proglacial lakes in northern latitudes, and glacial meltwater pulses cooling the Gulf of Mexico and North Atlantic Ocean. The Delta%C-4 after 6.7 ka (isotopic stage 1) increased to modern levels as conditioned by the outflow of warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico and dry incursions from the west that produced periodic drought. At the millennial-scale, time series analysis demonstrates that Delta%C-4 oscillated with 0.6 and 1.8 ka periodicities, possibly governed by variations in solar irradiance. Our buried soil isotopic record correlates well with other environmental proxy from the Great Plains and surrounding regions. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

J	WELHAM, CVJ; YDENBERG, RC				WELHAM, CVJ; YDENBERG, RC			NET ENERGY VERSUS EFFICIENCY MAXIMIZING BY FORAGING RING-BILLED GULLS	BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY												Ring-billed gulls (Larus delawarensis) breeding at Dog Lake, Manitoba [Canada] often feed by following tractors pulling cultivating implements around fields. Tractor-following gulls always land immediately behind the cultivating implement, where they feed on earthworms or grain. After a feeding bout on the ground (patch residence time), gulls fly up, pursue the tractor and repeat the cycle. We use net energy maximizing (energy gained per unit time) and efficiency maximizing (energy gained per unit energy expended) models to make quantitative predictions of patch residence time, and compare these predictions to observations. If we assume flight speed to be constrained at the observed mean, the observations fall between the predictions of the two models, and the models explain approximately equal and highly significant proportions of the ovarall variation in patch residence time. If both flight speed and patch residence time are allowed to vary in the models, the efficiency maximizing model more closely predicts observed patch residence times, and the net energy maximizing model more closely predicts observed flight speed. We discuss whether breeding ring-billed gulls may be truly intermediate between net energy and efficiency maximizing, and how measurements of flight speed may be useful in further investigations.																			0340-5443	1432-0762					1988	23	2					75	82		10.1007/BF00299890	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00299890													WOS:A1988P864700003

Continental-Scale Gene Flow Prevents Allopatric Divergence of Pelagic Freshwater Bacteria	GENOME BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Allopatric divergence is one of the principalmechanisms for speciation of macro-organisms. Microbes by comparison are assumed to disperse more freely and to be less limited by dispersal barriers. However, thermophilic prokaryotes restricted to geothermal springs have shown clear signals of geographic isolation, but robust studies on this topic for microbes with less strict habitat requirements are scarce. Furthermore, it has only recently been recognized that homologous recombination among conspecific individuals provides species coherence in a wide range of prokaryotes. Recombination barriers thus may define prokaryotic species boundaries, yet, the extent to which geographic distance between populations gives rise to such barriers is an open question. Here, we investigated gene flow and population structure in a widespread species of pelagic freshwater bacteria, Polynucleobacter paneuropaeus. Through comparative genomics of 113 conspecific strains isolated from freshwater lakes and ponds located across a North-South range of more than 3,000 km, we were able to reconstruct past gene flow events. The species turned out to be highly recombinogenic as indicated by significant signs of gene transfer and extensive genome mosaicism. Although genomic differences increased with spatial distance on a regional scale (<170 km), such correlations were mostly absent on larger scales up to 3,400 km. We conclude that allopatric divergence in European P. paneuropaeus is minor, and that effective gene flow across the sampled geographic range in combination with a high recombination efficacy maintains species coherence.

A prime example are repositories of Open Data which show great promise for transparent data science. Due to the lack of proper integration, Data Lakes may not have a common consistent schema and traditional data management techniques fall short with these repositories. Much recent research has tried to address the new challenges associated with these data lakes. Researchers in this area are mainly interested in the structural properties of the data for developing new algorithms, yet typical Open Data portals offer limited functionality in that respect and instead focus on data semantics. We propose LOCH PROSPECTOR, a visualization to assist data management researchers in exploring and understanding the most crucial structural aspects of Open Data - in particular, metadata attributes - and the associated task abstraction for their work.

Basalts of the Zhom-Bolok Lava River as a Possible Sources of Metallic Iron in Sediments of Local Lakes: Thermomagnetic and Microprobe Justification	RECENT ADVANCES IN ROCK MAGNETISM, ENVIRONMENTAL MAGNETISM AND PALEOMAGNETISM	Springer Geophysics				International Conference on Geomagnetism, Paleomagnetism and Rock Magnetism	OCT, 2017	Kazan, RUSSIA					The results of thermomagnetic and microprobe studies of basalts of the Zhom-Bolok lava river (East Sayan) are given in the article. On the example of the Zhom-Bolok basalt lava river the process of settling of metallic iron particles in a basaltic lava has been demonstrated. Some of examples show the distribution of metallic iron particles during their settling within basaltic lava flows. It has been shown that the main source of metallic iron in lake sediments is the volcanic rocks of the Zhom-Bolok basaltic lava river, detrital material being created through erosion and weathering. Out of numerous studied objects Zhom-Bolok region is a single example of significant enrichment of sediments with metallic iron of terrestrial origin in the immediate vicinity of large eruptions of basaltic lava. Accordingly the halo of scattering of metallic iron particles from the centers of volcanic eruptions and/or the fall of large meteorites and other cosmic bodies to Earth is very limited.

Detailed characterization of the complex, subsaline/freshwater system in this study is aimed to be the contribution to the global wetland inventory. The distribution and behaviour of major and trace elements in water from the Neusiedler Lake Basin (Austria) were investigated. Two water types were proposed: CaNaHCO3 and CaHCO3. Toxic metals were discussed in comparison with the sediment quality criteria, and Ni was above the value that might cause severe toxic effects. TOC/TN ratio in sediments suggested terrestrial origin of organic matter. Significant variation of trace elements in water was noticed among the sampling sites. Although the Wulka River was anthropogenically influenced, only dissolved Zn, As and U were above world average values. This was the consequence of precipitation and metal adsorption onto suspended particles. Cd, Zn, Mn and Fe were the highest in acidic spring, where low pH maintains metals in a dissolved form. Uranium amounts near closed coalmine exceeded maximum allowed concentration (20 mu g L-1). Majority of elements in water and sediment have normal statistical distribution, with a small number of anomalies, thus indicating moderate anthropogenic influence.

Early life history stages were collected over multiple years from known nursery habitats using plankton, fyke and larval seine nets. The larvae are described using morphometric measurements, meristic counts and pigmentation based on 29 individuals. Solea turbynei is differentiated from other Soleidae by the small size at flexion (3-4 mm), low myomere count and presence of two characteristic blotches of pigment on the dorsal fin. This species has a unique early life history strategy in that the larvae progressively span nearshore, surf zone and estuarine habitats with ontogeny. Abundance of preflexion stages peaks in summer in nearshore waters, indicative of peak spawning period but preflexion larvae are present throughout the year, indicating protracted spawning by adults. At flexion stage, larvae utilize surf zones where metamorphosis and settlement takes place. Early juveniles migrate into the sandy lower reaches of estuaries, after which fish take up residency to adulthood. Warm water is important for larval growth and survival in the nearshore, while turbidity shows a positive relationship with recruitment into estuarine nurseries.

Due to the large-scale and long-term nature of the related hydrological processes, environmental tracers are required for SGD investigation. The water parameters of electrical conductivity and temperature, the naturally occurring radionuclides of radon and radium as well as the stable water isotopes O-18 and H-2 have proven in previous studies their general suitability for the detection and quantification of SGD. However, individual hydrogeological settings require a site-specific application of this tool box. This study evaluates and compares the applicability of the abovementioned tracers for investigating SGD from a distinct submarine source in a karst environment at Cabbe, southern France. The specific advantages and disadvantages of each individual parameter under the given hydrogeological conditions are discussed. Radon appeared to be the most suitable environmental tracer in the site specific context. The water temperature was less reliable due to the little temperature difference between seawater and groundwater and since the diurnal variation of the air temperature masks potential SGD signals. Radium isotopes are less applicable in the studied region due to the lack of a well-developed subterranean estuary. The stable water isotopes showed results consistent with the salinity and radon data; however, the significantly higher effort required for stable isotope analyses is disadvantageous. A multi-temporal thermal remote sensing approach proved to be a powerful tool for initial SGD surveying.					; Scholten, Jan/AFO-0385-2022; Mallast, Ulf/I-6335-2019	Mallast, Ulf/0000-0001-9238-3464; 														2073-4441				MAR	2014	6	3					584	601		10.3390/w6030584	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w6030584													WOS:000335896000008

Seasonal and spatial pattern of dissolved organic matter biodegradation and photodegradation in boreal humic waters	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Studying the competitive effects of microbial and light-induced transformation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and trace metals is crucially important for understanding the factors controlling aquatic carbon (C), micronutrient and toxicant transformation in boreal waters. Here we determined the biodegradability and photodegradability of DOM and their effects on the behavior of dissolved trace metals in humic surface waters from the European subarctic: an ombrotrophic peat bog continuum (subsurface water-peatland pool-stream) and a stratified forest lake across seasons. Along the bog water continuum, the biodegradation rate was the highest in subsurface waters and the lowest in the acidic peatland pool. Photodegradation was similar for subsurface waters and the stream but was not detectable in the peatland pool. The waters of the forest lake exhibited a strong seasonal effect of biodegradation, which was the highest in October and the lowest in June. Overall, the biodegradation was capable of removing between 1 % and 7 % of initial dissolved organic carbon (DOC), being the highest in the forest lake in October and in the peatland pool in summer. Photolysis was capable of degrading a much higher proportion of the initial DOC (10 %-25 %), especially in the forest lake during June and the bog stream during July. Only a few trace metals (TMs) were sizably affected by both photodegradation and biodegradation of DOM (Fe, Al, Ti, Nb and light rare-earth elements (REEs)), whereas V, Mn, Co, Cu and Ba were affected solely by biodegradation. A likely mechanism of metal removal was their co-precipitation with coagulating Fe(III) hydroxides. Compared to typical CO2 emissions from inland waters of the region, biodegradation of DOM can provide the totality of CO2 evasion from lake water surfaces, whereas biodegradation and photodegradation are not sufficient to explain the observed CO2 fluxes in the bog water continuum. Overall, these results demonstrated strong spatial and seasonal variability in biodegradation and photodegradation of DOM and organic TM complexes, and we call for the need for a systematic assessment of both processes across seasons with high spatial resolution.

O.; Mac Niocaill, Conall			A unified intensity of the magnetic field in the protoplanetary disk from the Winchcombe meteorite	METEORITICS & PLANETARY SCIENCE												One key feature of our protoplanetary disk that shaped its transformation into a system of planetary bodies was its vast magnetic field. Unique constraints on the properties of this field can be gleaned from paleomagnetic measurements of certain meteorites. Here, we apply this approach to the recent CM chondrite fall Winchcombe with the aim of constructing the most complete and reliable record to date of the behavior of the disk field in the outer solar system. We find that the interior of Winchcombe carries a stable, pre-terrestrial magnetization that likely dates from the period of aqueous alteration of the CM chondrite parent body. This remanence corresponds to a paleointensity of 31 +/- 17 mu T accounting for the average effect of parent body rotation. Winchcombe is rich in framboids and plaquettes of magnetite, which formed via precipitation following the dissolution of iron sulfide. This contrasts with most other CM chondrites, where magnetite formed predominantly via pseudomorphic replacement of FeNi metal. Accounting for the potential differences in recording fidelities of these types of magnetite, we find that the reported paleointensities from all CM chondrites to date are likely underestimates of the disk field intensity in the outer solar system, and use our measurements to calculate a unified intensity estimate of similar to 78 mu T. This paleointensity is consistent with two independent values from recent studies, which collectively argue that the disk field could have played a larger role in shaping the behavior of the disk in the outer solar system than previously considered.

A stochastic movement model reproduces patterns of site fidelity and long-distance dispersal in a population of Fowler's toads (Anaxyrus fowleri)	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Although amphibians typically exhibit high site fidelity and low dispersal, they do undertake rare, long-distance movements. The factors influencing these events remain poorly understood, partly because amphibian spring movements tend to radiate from breeding sites and the animals are often difficult to locate at other times of the year. In this study, we investigate whether these movement patterns can be reproduced by a parsimonious model where foraging steps follow a heavy-tailed, Levy alpha-stable distribution and individuals may either return to a previous refuge site or establish a new one. We consider three versions of the return behaviour: (1) a distance-independent probability of return to any previous refuge; (2) constant probability of return to the nearest refuge; or (3) a distance-dependent probability of return to each refuge. Using approximate Bayesian computation, we fit each version of the model to radiotracking data from a population of Fowler's Toads, which inhabits a linear sand dune habitat on the north shore of Lake Erie in Ontario, Canada. Only the model with distance-independent, random returns provides a good fit of the inter-refuge distance distribution and the number of refuges visited per toad. Our results suggest that while toads occasionally forage over long distances, the establishment of new refuges is not driven by the minimization of energy expenditure. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Hydrological systems from the Antarctic Peninsula under climate change: James Ross archipelago as study case	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Hydrological systems of the ice-free areas of the James Ross archipelago (NE Antarctic Peninsula) provide a unique opportunity for studying recent environmental changes associated with the current Global Warming. Geochemical, hydrological, sedimentological, and magnetic studies were carried out on different lake systems and ephemeral ponds from post-Holocene periglacial environments to characterize their natural variability. Significant differences between the lakes were observed based on physicochemical analyses, and can be attributed to several characteristics and processes taking place (geochemical, diagenetic, biological, etc.) in individual lake catchments. Seymour-Marambio Island's lakes exhibit high total dissolved solids (similar to 3.300 mg L-1) due to the high rate of evaporation in the region, whereas trace elements show differences in the lithological source. Lakes from Vega and James Ross islands are comparatively diluted, with the highest pH values up to 10.2. Within Vega Island, trace elements discriminate lakes into sectors which show statistical differences due to variations in lithological sources. Dissolved sources can be divided according to their kinetics into: high-rate processes which occur during summer months (evaporation, salt precipitation, atmospheric precipitation, melting processes) and low-rate processes (mineral weathering, giving a long-term signature). The present multidisciplinary study contributes to a better understanding of Antarctic lake systems, and can be used as a baseline dataset for further studies investigating the impact of recent climate changes on the biological and geochemical characteristics of these pristine ecosystems in the future.					; Kopalová, Kateřina/M-6207-2017; Lecomte, Karina/KHD-3796-2024; Chaparro, Marcos/O-9042-2019; Kopalova, Katerina/M-6207-2017	Irurzun, Alicia/0000-0002-4013-7808; Chaparro, Mauro A.E./0009-0005-5983-8398; LECOMTE, KARINA LETICIA/0000-0001-6901-0918; Gargiulo, Jose Daniel/0000-0002-8285-3634; Kopalova, Katerina/0000-0002-7905-4268; Bohnel, Harald/0000-0002-3833-225X; Chaparro, Marcos/0000-0003-2832-2151; Vignoni, Paula/0000-0002-9681-4986; Cordoba, Francisco E./0000-0001-8341-4951													1866-6280	1866-6299				APR	2016	75	7							623	10.1007/s12665-016-5406-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-016-5406-y													WOS:000373635400082

CO2 is Dominant Greenhouse Gas Emitted from Six Hydropower Reservoirs in Southeastern United States during Peak Summer Emissions	WATER												During August- September 2012, we sampled six hydropower reservoirs in southeastern United States for CO2 and CH4 emissions via three pathways: diffusive emissions from water surface; ebullition in the water column; and losses from dam tailwaters during power generation. Estimates of average areal emission rates of CO2 attributable to the six reservoirs ( i. e., reservoir plus tailwater emissions) ranged from 994 to 2760 mg center dot m-2 center dot day - 1, which is low to moderate compared to CO2 emissions rates reported for tropical hydropower reservoirs and boreal ponds and lakes, and similar to rates reported for other temperate reservoirs. Similar average rates for CH4 were also relatively low, ranging from 6 to 187 mg center dot m - 2 center dot day-1. On a whole- reservoir basis, estimates of total emissions of CO2 ranged 10- fold, from 42,740 kg per day for Fontana to 501,151 kg per day for Guntersville, and total emissions of CH4 ranged over 30- fold, from 251 kg per day for Fontana to 9153 kg per day for Allatoona. Emissions through the tailwater pathway varied among reservoirs, comprising from 19% to 65% of total CO2 emissions and 0% to 84% of CH4 emissions, depending on the reservoir. Emission rates were significantly correlated with several reservoir morphological and water quality characteristics, including metrics related to vertical stratification ( e. g., minimum water column temperature and maximum dissolved oxygen) and reservoir productivity ( e. g., water transparency and chlorophyll a concentration).					; stewart, arthur/D-8471-2012; Phillips, Jana/G-4755-2016	Mosher, Jennifer/0000-0001-6976-2036; stewart, arthur/0000-0003-1968-5997; Phillips, Jana/0000-0001-9319-2336														2073-4441				JAN	2016	8	1							15	10.3390/w8010015	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w8010015													WOS:000369512800019

Phosphorus (P) concentrations in the water column of lakes and wetlands are crucial to their trophic status and ecosystem function, but quantifying the processes controlling P concentrations in the field has been a difficult task. A site-based, in-lake method is described to partition major field processes controlling P concentration in a shallow lake. 2. It involves W in-lake deployment of a suite of chambers that isolate in-chamber activities from atmospheric sources, groundwater input and horizontal water movement; (ii) monitoring P concentrations and relevant water properties inside and outside the isolation chambers; and (iii) calculating the contribution of each individual process by simple mathematical deduction, so as to differentiate the contributions from the different sources. 3. The method was applied at nearshore and offshore sites in a seasonal, groundwater-fed shallow lake on the Swan Coastal Plain, south-western Australia, during winter refilling. Primary (atmospheric and groundwater) and secondary processes (e.g. circulation and sediment-water interactions) were partitioned and quantified in terms of their contributions to water column P [as total P (TP; mug m(-2) day(-1))]. 4. Atmospheric and groundwater inputs were the two main processes contributing P loadings (1233 and 1010 mug P m(-2) day(-1)), but their influence appeared restricted to the near-shore site. The estimated influence on TP by mixing-circulation, atmosphere and groundwater were 2.4-25 times higher near the lake margin as compared with the offshore site. The circulation and sediment-water interactions decreased water column P at the marginal site, but increased P offshore because of subsequent P release from sediment and a concurrent increase in pH. 5. Results are consistent with data reported elsewhere, and the factors that could affect the accuracy of partitioning are discussed.

J	Peden, AE; Willcox-Pidgeon, S				Peden, Amy E.; Willcox-Pidgeon, Stacey			Autism spectrum disorder and unintentional fatal drowning of children and adolescents in Australia: an epidemiological analysis	ARCHIVES OF DISEASE IN CHILDHOOD												Objectives This study explored unintentional fatal drowning among children and adolescents (0-19 years) diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in Australia. Design This total population, cross-sectional audit used data from the Royal Life Saving National Fatal Drowning Database to explore demographic and causal factors in ASD drowning cases between 1 July 2002 and 30 June 2018. Rates and relative risk (RR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated for drowning cases with and without ASD, using estimated population-level prevalence data. Results Of the 667 cases of drowning among 0-19 year olds with known medical history, 27 children and adolescents (4.0%) who drowned had an ASD diagnosis. Children and adolescents with ASD were three times more likely to drown than those without ASD (RR=2.85; CI 0.61 to 13.24). Among those with ASD, 0-4 year olds record the highest rate (11.60/100 000 diagnosed). Children and adolescents with ASD were significantly more likely to drown when compared with those without ASD: if aged 5-9 years (44.4% of ASD-yes cases; 13.3% of ASD-no cases); in a lake or dam (25.9% vs 10.0%) and during winter (37.0% vs 13.1%). Conclusion Heightened awareness of drowning risk for children and adolescents with ASD is required, including adult supervision and barriers restricting water access. Further evaluation of the effectiveness of personal alarms to alert caregivers to an unsupervised child is warranted. Challenges exist regarding accurate estimates of population-level ASD prevalence and identification of ASD in coronial files. As the diagnosis of ASD does not often occur until age five, results may be an underestimate.

Optimal Cyanobacterial Pigment Retrieval from Ocean Colour Sensors in a Highly Turbid, Optically Complex Lake	REMOTE SENSING												To date, several algorithms for the retrieval of cyanobacterial phycocyanin (PC) from ocean colour sensors have been presented for inland waters, all of which claim to be robust models. To address this, we conducted a comprehensive comparison to identify the optimal algorithm for retrieval of PC concentrations in the highly optically complex waters of Lake Balaton (Hungary). MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) top-of-atmosphere radiances were first atmospherically corrected using the Self-Contained Atmospheric Parameters Estimation for MERIS data v.B2 (SCAPE-M_B2). Overall, the Simis05 semi-analytical algorithm outperformed more complex inversion algorithms, providing accurate estimates of PC up to +/- 7 days from the time of satellite overpass during summer cyanobacteria blooms (RMSElog < 0.33). Same-day retrieval of PC also showed good agreement with cyanobacteria biomass (R-2 > 0.66, p < 0.001). In-depth analysis of the Simis05 algorithm using in situ measurements of inherent optical properties (IOPs) revealed that the Simis05 model overestimated the phytoplankton absorption coefficient [a(ph)(lambda)] by a factor of similar to 2. However, these errors were compensated for by underestimation of the mass-specific chlorophyll absorption coefficient [a*(chla)(lambda)]. This study reinforces the need for further validation of algorithms over a range of optical water types in the context of the recently launched Ocean Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) onboard Sentinel-3.

J	COWGILL, UM				COWGILL, UM			THE DISTRIBUTION OF PHYLLOQUINONE (VITAMIN-K1) IN A SMALL INLAND LAKE	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Relatively little is known of the behavior of vitamin K1 (phylloquinone) in aquatic systems. Thus the purpose of this study was to discover the distribution of phylloquinone in Linsley Pond, a kettle hole in North Branford Connecticut, U.S.A. Over a period of three successive summers, samples were taken of aquatic macrophytes, plankton, water representing the entire water column, water-mud interface and mud from the littoral zone as well as the deep water. Water samples as well as the liquid portion of the mud-water interface samples were examined for vitamin K1 in both the filtered and unfiltered state. The results show that vitamin K1 is detectable only in aquatic macrophytes and plankton tows. It is not detectable in filtered water (0.22 .mu.m millipore), filtered liquid of the mud-water interface samples or in the mud. It is hypothesized that phylloquinone present in dead plant material or in phytoplankton deposited in the mud or suspended in water is subjected to bacterial degradation and therefore is not detectable in nonliving substrates.																			0003-9136					AUG	1989	116	2					199	208																WOS:A1989AM67200005

Schwertmannite to jarosite conversion in the water column of an acidic mine pit lake	MINERALOGICAL MAGAZINE												Ferric precipitates in the water column at the San Telmo acidic mine pit lake in the Iberian Pyrite Belt, southwest Spain, have been studied by scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry, X-ray diffraction, X-ray fluorescence, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and other complementary techniques. These Fe(III) precipitates were recovered from sediment traps which were left at different depths (25, 35, 40 and 100 m) in the lake for several months. Seasonal variations in the water chemistry were recorded to link the mineralogical findings to vertical and temporal changes in aqueous composition. The results indicate that schwertmannite is the first Fe(III) mineral to crystallize after the oxidation of Fe(II), in agreement with previous studies. Schwertmannite is kinetically favoured in comparison to other Fe(III) minerals, and it buffers the pH at 2.6-3.0. It is metastable, and alters to a (H3O+)- and (K+)-bearing jarosite (containing 58 mol.% H3O+ and 42 mol.% K+ on average) at lower pH (e.g. at pH 2.2-2.5 in the summer season), either in the water column (during settling) and/or in the benthic sediments, in a time period of weeks to months. The extent of hydronium substitution at the alkali site in the jarosite reflects the higher activity of free aqueous protons in solution (10(-2.2) to 10(-3.0)) in comparison to the activities of K+ (10(-4.5)) and Na+ (10(-3.2)). Microscopic examination of mixed schwertmannite-jarosite precipitates found in the water column suggest that some textural and compositional features of metastable schwertmannite (e. g. the internal 'pincushion' arrangement and incorporation of trace amounts of Mg, Al, As and Pb) are conserved in the jarosite during the early stages of the mineralogical transformation, but many of these relics are lost in the later stages of crystal growth. Despite the hydronium-rich nature of the jarosite solid solution, this material is also an important sink for K+, which decreases in concentration with decreasing pH unlike most of the other major cations in the water column (notably Na+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Al3+, Fe3+, Cu2+, Zn2+). In addition to the release of Fe3+ to the aqueous solution, the conversion of schwertmannite to (H3O+, K+)-bearing jarosite consumes protons and thus may represent an additional pH control at San Telmo and other acidic mine pit lakes of the area.

These targets generally require nutrient reductions for attaining prescribed water quality standards (WQS) by setting safe levels of nutrient concentrations that curtail potentially harmful cyanobacteria blooms (CyanoHABs). While some governments require WQS to consider climate change, few tools are available to model the complex interactions between climate change and benthic legacy nutrients. We present a novel process-based integrated assessment model (IAM) that examines the extent to which synergistic relationships between GCC and legacy Phosphorus release could compromise the ability of water quality policies to attain established WQS. The IAM is calibrated for simulating the eutrophic Missisquoi Bay and watershed in Lake Champlain (2001-2050). Water quality impacts of seven P-reduction scenarios, including the 64.3% reduction specified under the current TMDL, were examined under 17 GCC scenarios. The TMDL WQS of 0.025 mg/L total phosphorus is unlikely to be met by 2035 under the mandated 64.3% reduction for all GCC scenarios. IAM simulations show that the frequency and severity of summer CyanoHABs increased or minimally decreased under most climate and nutrient reduction scenarios. By harnessing IAMs that couple complex process-based simulation models, the management of water quality in freshwater lakes can become more adaptive through explicit accounting of GCC effects on both the external and internal sources of nutrients.					; Bitterman, Patrick/AAA-2259-2019; Mohammed, Ibrahim/H-7798-2013; Hecht, Jory/KGM-6333-2024	zia, asim/0000-0001-8372-6090; Schroth, Andrew/0000-0001-5553-3208; Mohammed, Ibrahim/0000-0002-6542-319X; Turnbull, Scott/0000-0002-4384-652X; Clemins, Patrick J./0000-0002-7930-3025; Bitterman, Patrick/0000-0002-2715-606X														2328-4277				MAY	2022	10	5							e2021EF002234	10.1029/2021EF002234	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2021EF002234													WOS:000792956500001

Full-scale treatment resulted in effluent chemical oxygen demand, total nitrogen, NH3-N and total phosphorus of 35.1, 5.20, 3.10 and 0.15 mg/L, respectively, with a total removal efficiency of 91.1%, 67.1%, 70.5% and 89.3%, respectively. In this process, short-circuited organic carbon from brewery wastewater was beneficial for denitrification and second-sulfate reduction. The concentration of effluent fluoride was 6.22 mg/L, which also met the primary standard. Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry analysis revealed that many types of refractory compounds were present in the inflow. Microbial community analysis performed in the summer by PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and MiSeq demonstrated that certain special functional bacteria, such as denitrificans, phosphorus-accumulating bacteria, sulfate-and perhafnate-reducing bacteria, aromatic compound-degrading bacteria and organic fluoride-degrading bacteria, present in the bio-tanks were responsible for the acceptable specific biological pollutant reduction achieved.					li, chaoran/HGT-7499-2022; Xu, Ming/IWM-0504-2023														0959-3330	1479-487X					2018	39	2					253	263		10.1080/09593330.2017.1298676	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09593330.2017.1298676								28278102					WOS:000428629500011
J	Asirok, E; Kirillin, G				Asirok, Ezgi; Kirillin, Georgiy			Breathing in sleep: oxygen dynamics during the polar night in an Arctic lake	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Seasonally ice-covered Arctic lakes lack solar radiation during polar nights, and snow cover can extend the dark period up to half a year of permanent darkness. We used high-resolution temperature and dissolved oxygen data from three winters in Arctic Lake Kilpisj & auml;rvi to quantify oxygen conditions. We applied vertically resolved single-column oxygen budget and lake-averaged oxygen budget approaches to estimate drivers of deep-water oxygen depletion. Deep-water hypoxia occurred in all 3 years, with timing and magnitude strongly influenced by under-ice temperature and mixing. Basin-scale internal waves with periods exceeding diurnal lengths were persistent, generating turbulence indicated by a vertical diffusion coefficient exceeding conductive values by an order of magnitude as the only large-scale motions under ice. The major physical factor on oxygen dynamics was the ice formation date. A 1-2 weeks earlier ice-on resulted in temperatures close to the maximum density, reduced vertical mixing, and intensification of bottom gravity currents. Downslope lateral transport by gravity currents produced accumulation of low oxygenated waters in deep layers, responsible for 55-85% of the near-bottom oxygen decrease, the rest contributed by local oxygen uptake by sediment. A delayed ice-on led to stronger vertical mixing and weaker oxygen depletion. Oxygen consumption was mainly controlled by bottom oxygen flux, while water column respiration contributed about 20% of total depletion. The results highlight sensitivity of under-ice oxygen dynamics to physical transport processes. The effect of ice formation date on under-ice oxygen content suggests potentially strong response of Arctic lakes to shortening of the ice cover.

In the present study, the spatio-temporal assessment of groundwater quality and hydrogeochemical processes, as well as, statistical analyses in the Azarshahr and Ajabshir planes located in the Urmia Lake basin were investigated. The results revealed that within six years (from 2014 to 2019), the value of total hardness was higher than the permissible level and the quality of groundwater for drinking was very hard and fresh in both planes. In 2019, 84 and 67% of the samples fell within the range of good to poor groundwater quality in the Azarshahr and Ajabshir planes, respectively. The temporal assessment with the help of water quality index values for both planes revealed a good groundwater quality for the Azarshahr plane and a good to poor groundwater quality for the Ajabshir plane. However, deterioration of water quality was observed in both planes from 2014 to 2019. The level of water quality for irrigation was better in the Azarshahr plane than in the Ajabshir plane, due to the presence of fewer salty sites. In addition, Ca-Mg-HCO3 and rock dominance were identified as hydrochemical facies and controlling factor in the groundwater of both planes, respectively. Multivariate statistical analyses indicated both natural and anthropogenic sources (such as weathering, fertilizers, and wastewater) for hydrochemical parameters. It was suggested to develop a comprehensive regulation to control the entry of pollutants into the groundwater of the study area.

Influence of Site Conditions, Shelter Objects, and Ectomycorrhizal Inoculation on the Early Survival of Whitebark Pine Seedlings Planted in Waterton Lakes National Park	FOREST SCIENCE												Whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis) is an endangered five-needle pine limited to high elevations in western North America. Populations are being decimated by white pine blister rust, mountain pine beetles, and fire suppression. Over 200,000 rust-resistant seedlings have been planted for restoration in the western United States, but survival rates are low. Several treatment combinations (planting on burns, in beargrass, near shelter objects, and with mycorrhizal inoculation) intended to enhance the survival of planted nursery seedlings were evaluated. Each of 21 plots contained four site condition combinations (burned/not, beargrass/not). Half of 983 seedlings were inoculated with the native ectomycorrhizal fungus Suillus sibiricus in the nursery. Seedlings were planted with/without a shelter object (stumps, logs, rocks). After 2 years, some of the highest seedling survival rates (82%) were in burned areas (prescribed torching) where beargrass mats were absent. In unburned areas with beargrass, mycorrhizal treatment increased survival 17-24% and when combined with shelter objects was 68-84%. Shelter objects increased survival 10-12.5% on burns and 31% on unburned areas without beargrass, where survival was low (42%). Overall, early seedling survival was higher than for other whitebark pine restoration attempts at 95% and 69% for years one and two, likely due to particular treatment combinations possibly helped by favorable spring moisture conditions.																			0015-749X	1938-3738				JUN	2014	60	3					603	612		10.5849/forsci.13-511	http://dx.doi.org/10.5849/forsci.13-511													WOS:000337662300016

Two 20 to deep boreholes instrumented with thermistors and located in a talus slope at 2400 to asl above a lake at Fluela Pass in the eastern Swiss Alps allow the analysis of the evolution of ground temperature and permafrost thickness between 2003 and 2008. The occurrence of intra-talus ventilation can be discerned due to thermal anomalies within a layer of coarse blocks with large voids at around 15 m depth near the base of the slope and at 10 m depth mid-slope. Intra-talus ventilation is particularly effective in winter when subzero air temperatures coincide with snow depths less than 50 cm and reverses to a gravity discharge of intra-talus air when air temperatures become positive. Despite the lack of annual variability in active layer depth, rapid permafrost degradation and thinning of ground ice (from 7 m thickness to 3.5 m in 4 years) is currently occurring. It is attributed to latent heat transfer from the moving air stream, caused by the flux of vapour from the relatively warm lake water table at 20 to depth and its condensation at the base of the permafrost body.

Trin. ex. Steud. and M. sacchariflorus Benth. are the 3 main species, in that sequence, constituting zonations from deeper water to drier areas along river banks and lake shores in central Japan. Their growth-responses were studied by transplanting them in an 8 m sloping field, constructed in a wet area. The driest and flooded ends of the slope were respectively, 60 cm above and 60 cm below the water level. Each species was planted in an area 1.7 .times. 8 m at a density of 35-36 plants m-2 in early Oct. 1975. Shoot length, density and some soil characteristics were measured from 1976-1978. When the yields were estimated in midsummer, best growth of the 3 spp. overlapped in the drier plots, showing a clear contrast with that of the natural distribution. When considering the yield or plant height in late spring, best growth occurred in the same sequences as in the natural distribution. This result suggests that optimal growth in the early stages is critical for the development of the natural distribution patterns when these species are grown together, because initial dominance in height is advantageous for subsequent competition.																			0304-3770	1879-1522					1981	10	3					229	239		10.1016/0304-3770(81)90025-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-3770(81)90025-5													WOS:A1981LR98200002
J	Weintroub, D				Weintroub, Dora			A preliminary account of the aquatic and sub-aquatic vegetation and flora of the witwatersrand	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												The area studied extends from Florida, 9 miles west of Johannesburg, to Brakpan, 23 miles east of this city. The sheets of water may be classified as follows: (1) Artificial dams, usually in connection with the gold mines, and, as a rule, of little botanical interest. (2) Semi-natural lakes, made by the artificial damming up of streams. Reed swamps occur, with the following plants locally dominant: Typha australis, Phragmites communis, Scirpus macrocarpus, and Cyperus fastigiatus. Of plants with floating leaves, Limnanthemum thun-bergianum is abundant in one of the lakes. Submerged plants occur, such as Potamogeton javanicus, P. badius, and a new, undescribed, sp. of Potamogeton. The margin is rich in marsh spp., including Juncus effusus, J. spp., Ranunculus sardous, R. meyeri var. transvaalensis, Nasturtium offidnale and Epilobium villosum. A new, undescribed var. of Spergulana marginata occurs. (3) Natural sheets of water, which are: (a) Pans, or shallow depressions whose origin is in dispute. They are frequently dry in winter. They have a typical and characteristic marginal flora, with Spergularia (aff. S. salina), Lessertia sp. nov., Cuscuta sp. nov., and others. Lemna minor, L. gibba, and Wolffia arrhiza occur locally in the pans of the East Rand. Potamogeton pectinatus var. and Zannichellia pedicellata occur in Brakpan. The pans have a rich plankton, consisting chiefly of copepods and diatoms. Volvox rousseleti and Hydrodictyon indicum (?) occur in Rietfontein pan. The pans have no streams flowing out of them, and consequently their mineral content is high, becoming almost supersaturated as the dry season approaches. Incrustations of salts are common on the receding margins of the pans, as the water evaporates. (b) Streams and their backwaters. The backwaters have the same flora as the lakes; and the stream banks yield the same plants as the margins of the lakes.																			0022-0477	1365-2745				FEB	1933	21	1					44	57		10.2307/2255873	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2255873													WOS:000202873400004

Drone-based digital elevation models and orthophotography were employed to critically assess the location, type and magnitude of sediment mobilization on two watercourses in the English Lake District (River Kent at Kendal, and River Greta at Keswick), following several geomorphologically effective floods between 2018 and 2020. The detailed 0.02 m resolution imagery was interrogated to quantify individual clast scale movement across the range of grain sizes present. It would appear that both sites have become armored over time with large cobbles remaining generally immobile during flood events, while smaller gravels are being supplied and transported through the study reaches until the falling limb when this material is prone to stalling in over-wide reaches. This flood mobility suggests that material of this caliber, although present in the reaches, is soon mobilized and moved downstream in a flood and does not act to increase local flood risk unless stabilized by vegetation.																			2522-8714	2522-8722	978-3-031-43924-7; 978-3-031-43922-3; 978-3-031-43921-6				2024							437	440		10.1007/978-3-031-43922-3_99	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-43922-3_99													WOS:001523756100099

Different benthic populations sampled in a 45 m deep artificial lake, with benthic life phases ranging from a few weeks to almost 3 years, were used to test the impact of three temperatures (4, 7 and 17 degrees C), the absence or presence of light and sediment mixing on Microcystis recruitment. In this study, sediment mixing was the only physical factor found to promote recruitment, indicating that passive resuspension plays a much more important role in the recruitment of Microcystis than light and temperature. Moreover, recruitment occurred from all benthic populations, including one that was nearly 3 years old. No difference in the proportion of recruited cells was observed before and after the usual overwintering period, suggesting that the annual benthic overwintering does not impair the ability of Microcystis to inoculate the water column in the following spring. However, in the oldest population, the proportions of recruited cells were lower under all the experimental conditions tested, indicating a decrease in the ability of older benthic populations of Microcystis to contribute to the recruitment process.

We measure two dimensions of this loss. As a first step, the extrapolation of our representative survey reports $100 million annual loss in terms of recreation revenue due to the trip reduction to LSP, which is about 60% of current level. Subsequently, the travel-cost data and the contingent behavior data are combined in a revealed and stated behavior panel random-effect estimation, which reports an additional loss measured by consumer surplus that visitors can obtain from their trips up to $232 million, signifying 42% of reduction in their current value.

A Shallow Cumuliform Snowfall Census Using Spaceborne Radar	JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY												The first observationally based near-global shallow cumuliform snowfall census is undertaken using multiyear CloudSat Cloud Profiling Radar observations. CloudSat snowfall observations and snowfall rate estimates from the CloudSat 2C-Snow Water Content and Snowfall Rate (2C-SNOW-PROFILE) product are partitioned between shallow cumuliform and nimbostratus cloud structures by utilizing coincident cloud category classifications from the CloudSat 2B-Cloud Scenario Classification (2B-CLDCLASS) product. Shallow cumuliform (nimbostratus) snowfall events comprise about 36% (59%) of snowfall events in the CloudSat snowfall dataset. The remaining 5% of snowfall events are distributed between other categories. Distinct oceanic versus continental trends exist between the two major snowfall categories, as shallow cumuliform snow-producing clouds occur predominantly over the oceans. Regional differences are also noted in the partitioned dataset, with over-ocean regions near Greenland, the far North Atlantic Ocean, the Barents Sea, the western Pacific Ocean, the southern Bering Sea, and the Southern Hemispheric pan-oceanic region containing distinct shallow snowfall occurrence maxima exceeding 60%. Certain Northern Hemispheric continental regions also experience frequent shallow cumuliform snowfall events (e.g., inland Russia), as well as some mountainous regions. CloudSat-generated snowfall rates are also partitioned between the two major snowfall categories to illustrate the importance of shallow snow-producing cloud structures to the average annual snowfall. While shallow cumuliform snowfall produces over 50% of the annual estimated surface snowfall flux regionally, about 18% (82%) of global snowfall is attributed to shallow (nimbostratus) snowfall. This foundational spaceborne snowfall study will be utilized for follow-on evaluative studies with independent model, reanalysis, and ground-based observational datasets to characterize respective dataset biases and to better quantify CloudSat snowfall detection and quantitative snowfall estimate uncertainties.

Native and introduced populations of smallmouth bass differ in concordance between climate and somatic growth	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												We characterized the association between climate and somatic growth in 125 North American populations of smallmouth bass Micropterus dolomieu. Using multivariate techniques (i.e., principal components and Procrustes analyses), we found an overall significant concordance between eight climate variables (cloud cover, frost frequency, precipitation, mean air temperature, minimum air temperature, maximum air temperature, mean summer air temperature, and growing degree-days above 10 degrees C) and four growth variables (body length increments for ages 1-4). Bivariate linear regressions revealed that there was a significant positive relationship between air temperature variables and early growth, while growth at later ages was generally less influenced by climate. Given that the geographical range of smallmouth bass has been rapidly expanding over the past century, we also examined how the climate-growth relationships differed in populations that have been introduced outside the native distribution. Analysis of residuals from the Procrustes test indicated that the concordance between climate and growth was probably higher for populations within the native range and lower for introduced populations. Mechanisms that might generate this pattern include the possibilities that (1) the introduced populations have not had time to adapt to their new environments and (2) growth might respond atypically to the more extreme climates experienced outside the native range of the species.

THE RISE AND FALL OF AN EPIZOOTIC OF THE DIPHYLLOBOTHRIIDEAN CESTODE SCHISTOCEPHALUS PUNGITII INFECTING THE NINESPINE STICKLEBACK	JOURNAL OF PARASITOLOGY												Epizootics of diphyllobothriidean cestodes appear to be simple, but deceptive similarity conceals the myriad ways in which these events are shaped by complex abiotic and biotic interactions. In Dog Bone Lake, Alaska, an epizootic of Schistocephalus pungitii infecting the ninespine stickleback (Pungitius pungitius) was short-lived. Its duration, with a peak that lasted only 1 yr, was shorter than for previously documented epizootics in Schistocephalus. solidus. The ability of the ninespine stickleback to sustain infections, which appears to be related to species-specific characteristics of the host, may have played an important role in shaping the epizootic. Moreover, the epizootic of S. pungitii was not coincident with those observed for S. solidus in earlier studies within this region, supporting the hypothesis that processes involved in epizootics largely reflect local (lake-level) influences on population dynamics of the parasite. The outbreak occurred at a time when the host population was not relatively dense, which is inconsistent with epidemiological theory and may be a consequence of the parasite's indirect life cycle. The variability of the unregulated and unstable epizootic events of diphyllobothriidean cestodes presents a challenge to understand the ecological and evolutionary factors influencing the prevalence of infections in host populations.																			0022-3395	1937-2345				FEB	2012	98	1					1	5		10.1645/GE-2868.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1645/GE-2868.1								21895527					WOS:000301398900001

There are not many validated numerical models that reproduce the physico-chemical behaviour of a lake. During the period March 2008-October 2019 we have been monitoring the filling and post-filling process of an old open-pit, forming the Meirama lake in NW Spain. With the data measured during these years we have had the opportunity to develop a model of the thermo-hydrochemical behaviour of the vertical profile of the lake. Thus, this article presents a vertical profile numerical model of the thermal behaviour and transport of sulfate of the lake under the current conditions of steady-state hydrodynamic operation, when the complete flooding of the mine pit was reached (May 2016-October 2019). The model developed has been a conservative diffusive transport model and a thermal conductive transport model. The developed model reproduces acceptably the vertical profiles of the analysed parameters. In these profiles, it can be seen that the chemocline originating from the filling process diffuses slowly. There are two differentiated water bodies separated by a chemocline. The model also reproduces the seasonal evolution of the temperature profile in the shallowest zone of the lake; i.e., there is a significant thermocline in the upper zone that tends to disappear during the winter season: it tends to homogenize at a temperature between 11 and 12 degrees C, tending to a vertical profile.

A review of the potential impacts of climate change on surface water quality	HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES												It is now accepted that some human-induced climate change is unavoidable. Potential impacts on water supply have received much attention, but relatively little is known about the concomitant changes in water quality. Projected changes in air temperature and rainfall could affect river flows and, hence, the mobility and dilution of contaminants. Increased water temperatures will affect chemical reaction kinetics and, combined with deteriorations in quality, freshwater ecological status. With increased flows there will be changes in stream power and, hence, sediment loads with the potential to alter the morphology of rivers and the transfer of sediments to lakes, thereby impacting freshwater habitats in both lake and stream systems. This paper reviews such impacts through the lens of UK surface water quality. Widely accepted climate change scenarios suggest more frequent droughts in summer, as well as flash-flooding, leading to uncontrolled discharges from urban areas to receiving water courses and estuaries. Invasion by alien species is highly likely, as is migration of species within the UK adapting to changing temperatures and flow regimes. Lower flows, reduced velocities and, hence, higher water residence times in rivers and lakes will enhance the potential for toxic algal blooms and reduce dissolved oxygen levels. Upland streams could experience increased dissolved organic carbon and colour levels, requiring action at water treatment plants to prevent toxic by-products entering public water supplies. Storms that terminate drought periods will flush nutrients from urban and rural areas or generate acid pulses in acidified upland catchments. Policy responses to climate change, such as the growth of bio-fuels or emission controls, will further impact freshwater quality.					; whitehead, paul/K-8689-2012	Wade, Andrew/0000-0002-5296-8350; Wilby, Robert/0000-0002-4662-9344													0262-6667	2150-3435				FEB	2009	54	1					101	123		10.1623/hysj.54.1.101	http://dx.doi.org/10.1623/hysj.54.1.101													WOS:000263690600009

Chemical profiles were used to estimate the amount of nutrients ac:cumulated in the hypolimnion during the stratified period. These estimates were compared with simulations made using the model of exponential decay, which showed a good performance in the case of Si but considerable underestimation in the case of P. The differences between the values simulated by the model and estimates based on field observations resulted from the additional P release from the sediments. This release could have been stimulated by a combination of factors, including the development of anoxic layers on the sediment-water interface and Si-induced desorption from Fe, Al and Mn oxides. Internal P loading during the stratified period was thus estimated at about 4-9 g/m(2), suggesting that rapid changes in the lake's trophic status are at present unlikely. Certain aspects of this work (including interpretation of interrelationships between ecosystem components, estimation of the decomposition constant. analysis of factors controlling nutrient accumulation in the hypolimnion, and a low-cost method to estimate intern; l P release) may be useful for studies of other aquatic systems and have, therefore, general limnological applicability.

J	SOLMAN, VEF				SOLMAN, VEF			THE ECOLOGICAL RELATIONS OF PIKE, ESOX-LUCIUS L AND WATERFOWL	ECOLOGY												The increase of agriculture on the Prairies during the last few decades, together with a decrease of precipitation, has reduced the availability of the Prairies as a breeding ground for waterfowl. The northern breeding areas have therefore become more important in maintaining the waterfowl population of N. America. Predation on young waterfowl by pike was reported from 44% of areas under observation by 207 observers. Its intensity varied, for instance at Littlefish Lake 0.42% of pike taken contained waterfowl, at Redrock Lake 7.5%, and at Baptizing Creek 3%. 45% of the waterfowl eaten were < 1 wk. old, and diving ducklings were taken 3 times as often as surface spp. Pike between 19 and 30 in. long were responsible for 71.5% of all predation on waterfowl, although this size range was only 23.3% of all pike taken which were large enough to prey on waterfowl. [female] pike contained on the avg. 3 times the wt. of food found in [male][male], although they were on the avg. but 1.14 in. longer; [female][female] comprised 47.8% of the population, but were responsible for 56% of the predation. This greater predation and greater food content are probably related to the greater observed growth rate. Predation by pike may destroy 1 young waterfowl per 0.6 acre (1.7 per acre) of water per season in areas like the Saskatchewan River delta. Since the combined areas of this and the Athabaska R. delta comprise over 900,000 acres as normal summer levels, the destruction of young waterfowl by pike may amount to 1,500,000 per yr., or 9.7% of the av. annual production of these areas.																			0012-9658	1939-9170					1945	26	2					157	170		10.2307/1930821	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1930821													WOS:A1945XX03500005

In this study, CO2 and CH4 fluxes were measured in water lettuce (Pistia stratiotes) and open water areas in Huixian wetland in Guangxi, Southwest China, from November 2020 to November 2021. Our results indicated that CO2/CH4 emissions showed obvious seasonal variations, CO2 fluxes for the water lettuce and open water zones showed a significant CO2 sink in winter, and CH4 fluxes for the water lettuce showed a maximum emission in September 2021. The annual cumulative CO2 fluxes for the water lettuce zone were 5,578.63 +/- 957.99 g m-2 yr-1, which were significantly higher than that from the open water area (2,551.77 +/- 482.49 g m-2 yr-1). Likewise, the annual cumulative CH4 emissions from the water lettuce area (693.39 +/- 142.88 g m-2 yr-1) were significantly higher than those from the open water zone (119.17 +/- 4.45 g m-2 yr-1). CO2 fluxes were significantly positively correlated with air and water temperature, and significantly negatively correlated with TN and DO. CH4 fluxes were significantly negatively correlated with HCO3-. This study indicated that the increased invasion of water lettuce may enhance GHG emissions from a subtropical lake, thus contributing to global warming. More attention should be paid to the invasion of floating plants into subtropical karst lakes because geological conditions and aquatic plants might significantly influence greenhouse gas emissions.																			0270-5060	2156-6941				DEC 31	2025	40	1							2516504	10.1080/02705060.2025.2516504	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.2025.2516504													WOS:001506310600001
J	Iang, X; Zhang, DL; Luo, YL				Iang, Xiaoling; Zhang, Da-Lin; Luo, Yali			Influences of Urbanization on an Afternoon Heavy Rainfall Event over the Yangtze River Delta Region	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW												An afternoon heavy rainfall event occurred over coastal Nantong, an area of 70-100 km downstream from the Shanghai-Suzhou-Wuxi-Changzhou city belt over the Yangtze River Delta, under the influences of weak southwesterly monsoonal flows and lake/sea breezes on 26 July 2018. An observational analysis shows the emergence of pronounced urban heat island (UHI) effects along the city belt during the late morning hours. A series of nested-grid cloud-permitting model simulations with the finest grid spacing of 1 km are performed to examine the impacts of urbanization on convection initiation (CI) and the subsequent heavy rainfall event. Results reveal the generation of lake breezes and warm anomalies in the planetary boundary layer along the city belt and low-level convergence, thereby inducing upward motion for CI. The southwesterly flows of the monsoonal warm-moist air, enhanced by the UHI effects along the city belt, allow the development of convective cells along the city belt, some of which merge with convective clusters during their downstream propagation, and the ultimate generation of several distinct heavy rainfall centers by local convective clusters over coastal Nantong where atmospheric columns are more moist and po-tentially unstable under the influences of sea breezes. Sensitivity simulations show small contribution of Nantong's UHI effects to the heavy rainfall event. The above findings help elucidate how the UHI effects could assist the CI in a weak-gradient environment, and explain why urbanization can contribute to increased downwind mean and extreme precipitation under the influences of favorable regional forcing conditions.

The carbon cycling model (abbreviated CCM) has in addition to the states variables of the EcoTaihu Model, the carbon in phytoplankton, zooplankton, fish, macroplant, hydrogen carbonate carbon, carbonate carbon, dissolved carbon, abiotic organic carbon in water, organic carbon in sediment, soluble organic carbon in pore water, inorganic carbon in sediments, soluble inorganic carbon in pore water and pH. The calibration and validation of the CCM showed that the model results are in good accordance with the observations (from the period February17 to December. 5, 2003). It implies that the model can be used to assess the variation of the carbon dioxide flux at the water-air interface, and to find the pH value of the lake water as function of time. According to the model, the carbon dioxide flux at the water-air interface has clear, diurnal variations. Eutrophied water is a sink for the atmospheric carbon dioxide due to the phytosynthesis during the summer. Due to the terrestrial input of carbon to the lake, lake Taihu is, however, a source of atmospheric carbon dioxide. The total annual flux is almost equal to the terrestrial input of carbon to the lake. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Microdarwinula zimmeri (Menzel) is, in Europe, an interstitial species. Darwinula stevensoni (Brady & Robertson), the type species of the genus, is also the most common darwinulid. Although it abounds in the shallow littoral of lakes, it can also occur in rivers, bogs and springs, both in fresh and saline waters. Darwinula boteai Danielopol is found in interstitial habitats in Rumania. Darwinula pagliolii Pinto & Kotzian, originally described from Recent South American populations, is reported from fossil, German localities. Darwinula brasiliensis Pinto & Kotzian, originally described as D. africana brasiliensis, also from South America, is here elevated to specific rank. It has been found extant in a bog in southern France and is reported from a museum collection from a Scottish lake. The latter species is here reported from Europe for the first time. Finally, Darwinula danielopoli n.sp. is also described from German Holocene (Subrecent) fossils. This species represents the first nominal taxon of a distinctly separate lineage within Darwinula s.l. Global and European distribution, history, ecological tolerance ranges, brooding and clonal taxonomy in this group are discussed.

The 2019 IntroductoryGroup atNADEF developed two precisely dated tree-ring width chronologies for Pinus contorta (lodgepole pine) and Pinus flexilis (limber pine) at the Wolf Knob site ca. 5 km west of Beartooth Lake, WY, within the bounds of the Shoshone National Forest (SNF), in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE). Wolf Knob is a semi-arid, S- to SW-facing, mid- to high-elevation site, making it an ideal location to examine the climate sensitivity of annual tree-ring width increments. Here, we show that two co-located Pinus species exhibit differing climate-growth relationships, with P. contorta exhibiting relatively weak correlations with precipitation (r = 0.37; p < 0.01) and temperature (r = -0.23; p < 0.05) during the late summer, and P. flexilis exhibiting stronger overall correlations with both cool-season (r = 0.48; p < 0.01) and warmseason precipitation (r = 0.51; p < 0.01) as well as with snowpack records (r = 0.45; p < 0.05). Our results suggest these two Pinus species may face disparate threats in the face of regional climate change, with P. flexilis being particularly vulnerable to drought conditions and declining snowpacks in the GYE. The differing seasonal climate sensitivities of the two species is likely caused by microsite conditions (e.g. soil moisture capacity, incoming solar radiation) and distinct species-climate responses, underscoring the importance of not only site selection, but also microsite and individual selection in dendroclimatological sampling. Finally, this work contributes to identifying Snow Water Equivalent (SWE)-sensitive treering proxies in the GYE, critical for understanding ongoing warming-induced snowpack declines across western North America, particularly given the projections of a largely snow-free (April 1) GYE by 2075.

The study was carried out in the & Ccedil;atak district, located in the south of Lake Van, between 4080000 and 4240000 north latitudes and 300000 and 370000 east longitudes (UTM WGS84) in eastern Turkey in 2021-2022. In the study, some important individual factors for vine growing such as the effect of heat summation (EHS), number of frost-free days, minimum winter temperature, aspect, slope, soil depth, and land use capability were evaluated using the GIS and weighted notation ratio result method, and based on this, a suitability analysis was carried out. It was determined that the distributions of the study area for first, second, and third suitability levels, respectively, were 0.72-26.05-52.50% for the earliest variety, 4.58-33.84-48.28% for the early variety, 1.15-22.56-58.47% for the mid-early varieties, 3.95-20.52-49.07% for the mid-season varieties, and 1.18-13.20-44.61% for the late variety.

Because they are not completely removed in sewage treatment plants, they eventually end up in aquatic environments. The aim of this reviewwas to summarize published information on effects of polycyclicmusks on aquatic organisms and to discuss whether the experimental design of toxicological studies involving these substances could influence the results obtained. With the exception of one study run in a flow-through system, all published toxicological studies on synthetic polycyclic musks have been conducted in semi-static or even static systems. Based upon data in the literature and our own results, we conclude that in toxicological tests with semi-static set-ups, concentrations of polycyclic musks decrease with time between bath exchanges, and, as a result, tested organisms are not being exposed to stable concentrations but rather to concentration pulses. The duration and character of these pulses are influenced mainly by aeration of experimental baths, as polycyclicmusks have a tendency to volatilize from water baths. Under semi-static conditions, tested organisms may be subjected to lower concentration of the tested substance for relatively long periods. Those levels may even fall below the limits of quantification. During these periods, some level of detoxification and/or elimination (depuration) of the toxicant may reduce toxic effect of the previous exposures. Consequently, toxicity of polycyclic musk substances for aquatic organisms obtained under these conditions may be underestimated. Based upon existing data in the literature, therefore, it is very difficult to correctly estimate risk of polycyclic musks to aquatic organisms. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

To address listing of winter-run Chinook salmon under the Endangered Species Act, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation began operating a temperature-control device (TCD) on Shasta Dam in 1997 that enabled selective withdrawal of reservoir outflows for control of downstream water temperatures while maximizing power generation. However, effectiveness of TCD operations for addressing fisheries concerns under hydroclimate variability is unknown. Stochastic methods to generate synthetic extreme hydroclimate conditions were combined with hydrodynamic modeling of reservoir operations and interactions with reservoir managers to examine the TCD's ability to meet downstream temperature objectives. Model simulations suggest that TCD withdrawal schedules could reduce outflow temperature target exceedances when compared with more traditional dam operations such as solely hypolimnetic or epilimnetic releases. However, constraints imposed by multipurpose operational considerations, especially under extreme climate conditions, and the Sacramento-San Joaquin system's complex regulatory environment limit use of reservoir management to provide optimal thermal conditions best for Chinook salmon spawning and recruitment.

We carried out a summer plankton sampling in 18 Patagonian lakes; 12 fishless, 5 with introduced fishes and 1 with endemic fish fauna. The lakes are situated on a latitudinal gradient from 39 degrees to 49 degrees S. Zooplankton and phytoplankton composition, phytoplankton relative abundance, and zooplankton body size and mouthpart morphology were analyzed. Results showed differences between lakes with and without fishes; in the presence of fish zooplankton size spectrum tended to be narrower because of the disappearance of Daphnia and large centropagid copepods. Zooplankton composition changed: centropagid species richness decreased and rotifers dominated. Contrarily, in fishless lakes 3 or 4 centropagid species, differing markedly in body size and exploiting different food niches, were observed co-occurring. These changes in zooplankton seemed to cascade down to phytoplankton. Fish introduction increased the phytoplankton similarity in lakes even belonging to different basins in a latitudinal gradient. indeed, cyanobacteria dominated only in lakes with introduced fishes. Probably the elimination of Daphnia favored cyanobacteria proliferation due to nutrient rebalance. As a consequence, water quality decreases and the value of sport fisheries is reduced. Fish introduction in Patagonia is a practice that should be re-evaluated by governments and NGOs due to its potentially negative impact on lakes and local economies. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Bacteria, archaea and fungi are crucial for the cycling of several important inorganic nutrients in soils. From 15 genera and 31 species of recovered microscopic filamentous fungi, a big group was melanized, of which most of them were also phytopathogenic. The second group consisted of keratinophilic species. Isolated bacteria mainly included members of the genera Arthrobacter, Bacillus, Massilia, Rhodococcus and Nocardiopsis. High-throughput sequencing analysis permitted a better view of the mycobiome and prokaryotic communities (comprising archaea). The cultivation and sequencing approaches were shown to be complementary. The aim of the work was to identify soil microorganisms, including the order Halobacteriales, and to discover the differences in species diversity depending on soil salinity and the presence of PTEs in soil.

J	Bushi, D; Nimasow, G				Bushi, Dhoni; Nimasow, Gibji			Seasonal variation of limnological parameters and phytoplankton dynamics in the high-altitude oligotrophic lakes of Tawang district, Arunachal Pradesh (India)	AQUATIC ECOLOGY												Seasonal variations of limnological parameters and phytoplankton dynamics in high-altitude oligotrophic lakes form a critical area of interest in assessing the implications and impact of climate change on fragile ecosystems and formulating effective conservation strategies. Thus, a study was conducted by sampling water from five High-Altitude Lakes (HALs) of Tawang district, Arunachal Pradesh between December 2019 and December 2021. The seasonal variations of seven physico-chemical parameters and phytoplankton's composition, distribution, and seasonal abundance were assessed. Further, the diversity, dominance, and evenness of phytoplankton were estimated and the relationship between limnological parameters and the phytoplankton species was established using Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA). The limnological parameters such as pH, dissolved oxygen, free carbon dioxide (FCO2), alkalinity, hardness, conductivity, and total dissolved solids (TDS) show significant seasonal variations among the HALs. A total of 50 phytoplankton species belonging to 8 Class and 33 Family were recorded. The order of phytoplankton dominance was Bacillariophyceae > Cyanophyceae > Zygnematophyceae > Chlorophyceae > Chrysophyceae = Dinophyceae, Euglenophyceae = Klebsormidiophyceae. The most abundant specieswere Cymbella sp., Gomphonema sp., Fragilaria sp., Navicula sp., Nitzchia sp. (Bacillariophyceae), Volvox sp., Pediastrum sp., Microspora sp. (Chlorophyceae), Oscillatoria sp., Lyngbya sp., Calothrix sp., Chroococcus sp. (Cyanophyceae), Spirogyra sp., Mougeotia scalaris, Cosmarium sp., Closterium sp. (Zygnematophyceae). The abundance of phytoplankton species varied seasonally with most copious in winter. The distribution, abundance, and diversity of phytoplankton were largely influenced by pH, hardness, FCO2, conductivity, and TDS levels. So, the findings of the study could be helpful in exploring the potentialities of introducing cold-water fisheries in HALs to ensure food security under climate change scenarios.

Lake responses to historical land use changes in northern Spain:: The contribution of non-pollen palynomorphs in a multiproxy study	REVIEW OF PALAEOBOTANY AND PALYNOLOGY												Environmental changes discussed in an earlier work using pollen, sedimentology, ostracods and charcoal proxies were evaluated with new non-pollen palynomorph data. The limits of non-pollen palynomorph biozones are consistent with the main environmental changes reported earlier in the Pre-Pyrenean Lake Estanya. The non-pollen palynomorph diagram from Lake Estanya Gran shows that changes in human activity during the last 2000 years are reflected in lake responses. Palaeoecological data from non-pollen palynomorphs have helped to determine the causes of these environmental changes, e.g. the lake use for hemp water-retting and its limnological impacts. The main change in the non-pollen palynomorph diagram is the expansion of Desmidiaceae, indicating more acid water conditions between 1220 AD and 1760 AD. The onset of Desmidiaceae in 1220 AD may be attributed to the development of farming and probably to the construction of water channels. Desmidiaceae undergo a considerable decline after 1760 AD, coinciding with the fall in hemp production in the XVIIIth century. Consequently, the lake water recovered the oligotrophic, status that had prevailed before 1220 AD. The perturbation caused by the introduction of hemp retting practices in Lake Estanya led to changes in all the proxies such as sedimentology, non-pollen palynomorphs, pollen and faunal communities.

Seven facies assemblages have been recognized: FAA-FAG. FAA represents a distal bottom lake assemblage, FAB and FAD are interpreted as tidal flat deposits, FAC and FAG are interpreted as fluvial systems, FAE sediments are deposited in a subtidal/shoreface setting, and FAG represents a meandering fluvial system. The identification of stratigraphic surfaces (SU, MFS, and MRS) and the relationship among the facies assemblages permit the characterization of several systems tracts: a falling-stage systems tract (FSST) followed by a lowstand systems tract (LST), a transgressive systems tract (TST), and a highstand systems tract (HST). The FSST and LST may have been controlled by the uplift of the Beni-Mamore forebulge, whereas TST may result from a quiescent stage in the forebulge. Subaerial unconformity two (SU2) records the passage from a tide-influenced depositional system to a fully continental depositional system. The Miocene tidal-influenced deposits in the Beni-Mamore Basin suggest that it experienced a connection, either with the South Atlantic Ocean or the Caribbean Sea or both. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The results show that the sedimentary period of the Shahejie Formation in the Chezhen Depression had an overall temperature change trend from hot to cold and simultaneously experienced a dry and wet balance-wet-dry and wet balance-wet transition process. The climatic parameters of the Shahejie Formation in the Chezhen Depression include a mean annual temperature of 8.1 degrees C-15.1 degrees C, a mean coldest monthly temperature of -0.1 degrees C-2 degrees C, a mean warmest monthly temperature of 18.6 degrees C-28 degrees C, a mean annual precipitation of 389-1164 mm, a wettest monthly precipitation amount of 215-262 mm, and a driest monthly precipitation amount of 8-48 mm. Climate change is believed to affect the rise and fall of lake levels to some extent. The quantitative reconstruction of these climatic parameters allows researchers to more intuitively understand the geological background of the Chezhen Depression and guide the exploration and development of oil and gas resources.

The aim of this research was to assess the water quality of the Stcinca-Costesti accumulation based on the results obtained from the determination of physical- chemical parameters and toxic pollutants. Stcinca-Costesti accumulation is situated on the border between Romania and Moldova in Botosani County. The elements determined for each sample related to the studied section are represented by: pH, dissolved oxygen. biochemical oxygen demand (B.O.D.), nitrite, nitrate, chlorides, sulphates, cadmium, nickel, lead zinc, copper and chromium. In order to establish the values of determined elements were applied standardized analytical methods. The average concentrations of analyzed heavy metals were below maximum permissible concentration for Ist class of quality. As a general conclusion based on these results, we can say that water from Stcinca-Costesti accumulation fall within the IInd class of quality in terms of the oxygen and in the Ist class of quality in terms of nutrients and heavy metals.					; Gabriel Vasile, Hoha/AAM-9929-2021; Pasarin, Benone/B-9030-2011; Nistor, Catalin Emilian/IAM-8222-2023; băcilă, vasile/C-8672-2015	Nistor, Catalin Emilian/0000-0002-6340-9415; 													2285-5750	2393-2260					2020	63	2					460	465																WOS:000594991500070

The lake sediments are comprised of organic matter, volcanic materials and aeolian input from nearby granitoid-derived soils. Variations in Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios in the lake sediments indicate two modes of climate conditions: wet intervals during which the lake sediments are mainly derived from the volcanic-lake rim materials, expressed in low Sr-87/Sr-66 ratios, and dry intervals during which fine particles from the nearby granitic soils are windblown to the lake and supply local dust expressed in high Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios in the sediments. These wet and dry intervals generally correspond to regional climate records (e.g., speleothem delta O-18 profiles in southeast China) and correlate with global climate events (e.g., Heinrich events). While delta O-18 records of speleothems from southeast China caves are dominated by the precession signal, the Huguangyan Maar Sr record mainly correlates with obliquity. This most likely reflects masking of the precession signal due to regional climate variability, accentuating the obliquity signal. These local effects may also account for some of the differences that have been observed between the various East Asian monsoon records. More importantly, the masking of the precession signal reveals the direct influence of obliquity on the hydro-climate regime in South China. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Yao, GQ; Li, L; Cai, MJ; Liu, YH				Yao, Guangqing; Li, Le; Cai, Mingjun; Liu, Yonghe			Mechanisms of salinization in a middle Eocene lake in the Tanggu area of the Huanghua Depression	MARINE AND PETROLEUM GEOLOGY												The Sha-3-5 Submember of the Shahejie Formation in the Tanggu area of the Huanghua Depression contains analcime-bearing dolomite, indicating salinization of an ancient lake during deposition. Solar evaporation and hydrothermal salinization have both been proposed as ways to generate these saline conditions. Based on a comprehensive analysis of core data, thin sections, spore and pollen data, elemental geochemistry, pyrolysis results, and vitrinite reflectance, we assessed the mechanisms driving salinization in light of provenance evolution, geothermal evolution, paleoclimate, mineral responses to evaporation, and the relationship between fluid temperature and salinity. The vertical profiles of FREE, Eu/*Eu, and T-max exhibit little variation, and the maximum paleotemperatures attained by organic matter are comparable to present-day drill hole temperature. No major changes in provenance or paleotemperature and no petrological fabrics that would indicate a hydrothermal input are observed in the studied section. However, evidence for a semi-humid to semi-arid climate, primary evaporitic textures and structures, and a positive relationship between fluid temperature and salinity all support evaporation as the primary mechanism driving rising salinity. Solar evaporation, rather than hydrothermal eruption, appears to have been the primary factor driving lake salinization during middle Eocene deposition of the dolomitic Sha-3-5 Submember.

J	Jiang, HC; Mao, X; Xu, HY; Thompson, J; Wang, P; Ma, XL				Jiang, Hanchao; Mao, Xue; Xu, Hongyan; Thompson, Jessica; Wang, Ping; Ma, Xiaolin			Last glacial pollen record from Lanzhou (Northwestern China) and possible forcing mechanisms for the MIS 3 climate change in Middle to East Asia	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												The vegetation on the northeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau is highly sensitive to climatic changes and thus represents a potentially interesting environmental archive. Pollen samples from the Fanjiaping Loess section in Lanzhou on the western Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP) were analyzed in conjunction with OSL dating. The results indicate that pollen zone B (60.6-46.0 ka, correlative to the early MIS 3) had the greatest abundances of Cupressaceae, Tsuga, Gramineae and Cyperaceae of the entire section, suggesting a warm phase during the last glacial period. These pollen taxa decreased significantly in abundance in the zones C (46.0-39.0 ka) and D (39.0-27.0 ka), reflecting a substantial climate cooling from the middle MIS 3 to MIS 2. These results correlate with climate records from the South China Sea, the CLP, Baikal Lake, North America, North Atlantic Ocean and other regions, and probably correspond with the decline of northern high-latitude insolation and the increase of global ice volume from 50 to 20 ka. In particular, arboreal pollen, fern spore and algae abundances declined sharply since similar to 40 ka, while shrub and herb pollen reached the highest abundances. Conifer pollen Picea and Abies abundance also rose markedly and increased up the section. This implies significant climate deterioration and likely corresponded with substantial growth of the polar ice sheets since similar to 40 ka. The decreasing temperature caused by an insolation decline during the last glacial period probably reinforced the cooling effect in a 'snow/ice/albedo' feedback, which would result in less climate sensitivity to radiative forcing. Meanwhile, vegetation decline in the Northern Hemisphere during the last glacial period and tundra development at high latitudes possibly caused additional cooling, enhancing the growth of polar ice sheets since 40 ka. The development of polar ice sheets increased the polar-to-equator temperature and pressure gradients, strengthening the westerlies and supplying plenty of moisture to Northwest China during 40-30 ka. Lake sediments developed widely on the Tibetan Plateau during 40-30 ka, probably related to an increase in the seasonality of middle-to-low latitude insolation which caused an enhancement of glacier melting on the Plateau.

A meta-analysis of global crop water productivity of three leading world crops (wheat, corn, and rice) in the irrigated areas over three decades	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH												The overarching goal of this study was to perform a comprehensive meta-analysis of irrigated agricultural Crop Water Productivity (CWP) of the world's three leading crops: wheat, corn, and rice based on three decades of remote sensing and non-remote sensing-based studies. Overall, CWP data from 148 crop growing study sites (60 wheat, 43 corn, and 45 rice) spread across the world were gathered from published articles spanning 31 different countries. There was overwhelming evidence of a significant increase in CWP with an increase in latitude for predominately northern hemisphere datasets. For example, corn grown in latitude 40-50 degrees had much higher mean CWP (2.45 kg/m(3)) compared to mean CWP of corn grown in other latitudes such as 30-40 degrees (1.67 kg/m(3)) or 20-30 degrees (0.94 kg/m(3)). The same trend existed for wheat and rice as well. For soils, none of the CWP values, for any of the three crops, were statistically different. However, mean CWP in higher latitudes for the same soil was significantly higher than the mean CWP for the same soil in lower latitudes. This applied for all three crops studied. For wheat, the global CWP categories were low (<= 0.75 kg/m(3)), medium (>0.75 to <1.10 kg/m(3)), and high CWP (>= 1.10 kg/m(3)). For corn the global CWP categories were low (<= 1.25 kg/m(3)), medium (>1.25 to <= 1.75 kg/m(3)), and high (>1.75 kg/m(3)). For rice the global CWP categories were low (<= 0.70 kg/m(3)), medium (>0.70 to <= 1.25 kg/m(3)), and high (>1.25 kg/m(3)). USA and China are the only two countries that have consistently high CWP for wheat, corn, and rice. Australia and India have medium CWP for wheat and rice. India's corn, however, has low CWP. Egypt, Turkey, Netherlands, Mexico, and Israel have high CWP for wheat. Romania, Argentina, and Hungary have high CWP for corn, and Philippines has high CWP for rice. All other countries have either low or medium CWP for all three crops. Based on data in this study, the highest consumers of water for crop production also have the most potential for water savings. These countries are USA, India, and China for wheat; USA, China, and Brazil for corn; India, China, and Pakistan for rice. For example, even just a 10% increase in CWP of wheat grown in India can save 6974 billion liters of water. This is equivalent to creating 6974 lakes each of 100 m(3) in volume that leads to many benefits such as acting as 'water banks' for lean season, recreation, and numerous ecological services. This study establishes the volume of water that can be saved for each crop in each country when there is an increase in CWP by 10%, 20%, and 30%.					; Teluguntla, Pardhasaradhi/AEG-2832-2022	Teluguntla, Pardhasaradhi/0000-0001-8060-9841; Gumma, Murali Krishna/0000-0002-3760-3935; Foley, Daniel/0000-0002-2051-6325; Aneece, Itiya/0000-0002-1201-5459; Thenkabail, Prasad/0000-0002-2182-8822; 													1753-8947	1753-8955				AUG 2	2020	13	8					939	975		10.1080/17538947.2019.1651912	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17538947.2019.1651912		AUG 2019											WOS:000484626800001

Reliable Future Climatic Projections for Sustainable Hydro-Meteorological Assessments in the Western Lake Erie Basin	WATER												Modeling efforts to simulate hydrologic processes under different climate conditions rely on accurate input data. Among other inaccuracies, errors in climate projections can lead to incorrect decisions. This study aimed to develop a reliable climate (precipitation and temperature) database for the Western Lake Erie Basin for the 21st century. Two statistically downscaled bias-corrected sources of climate projections (GDO: Global Downscaled Climate and Hydrology Projections and MACA: Multivariate Adaptive Constructed Analogs) were tested for their effectiveness in simulating historic climate (1966-2005) using ground-based station data from the National Climatic Data Center. MACA was found to have less bias than GDO and was better at simulating selected climate indices; thus, its climate projections were subsequently tested with different bias correction methods including the power transformation method, variance scaling of temperature, and Stochastic Weather Generators. The power transformation method outperformed the other methods and was used in bias corrections for 2006 to 2099. From the analysis, mean daily precipitation values were expected to remain more or less the same under both RCP (Representative Concentration Pathway) 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios, ranging between 2.4 mm and 3.2 mm, while standard deviations were expected to increase, pointing to a rescaling of the distribution. Maximum one-day precipitation was expected to increase and could vary between 120 and 650 mm across the basin, while the number of wet days could potentially increase under the effects of RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5. Both mean maximum and mean minimum daily air temperatures were expected to increase by up to 5.0 degrees C across the basin, while absolute maximum and minimum values could increase by more than 10 degrees C. The number of days in which precipitation could potentially fall as snow was expected to decrease, as was the annual number of days for optimal corn growth, although an earlier start to the growing season could be expected. Results from this study were very useful in creating a reliable climate database for the entire Western Lake Erie Basin (WLEB), which can be used for hydrologic, water resources, and other applications in the basin. The resulting climate database is published and accessible through the Purdue University Research Repository (Mehan et al., 2019), which is an open-access repository.					; Mehan, Sushant/Q-9862-2016	Flanagan, Dennis/0000-0001-7665-7170; Gitau, Margaret/0000-0002-4931-7047; Mehan, Sushant/0000-0002-1565-9591														2073-4441				MAR 20	2019	11	3							581	10.3390/w11030581	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w11030581													WOS:000464546700002
J	Theuerkauf, M; Joosten, H				Theuerkauf, Martin; Joosten, Hans			Younger Dryas cold stage vegetation patterns of central Europe - climate, soil and relief controls	BOREAS												In the north Atlantic region the final period of the last ice age saw abrupt shifts between near present-day warm and near ice age cold conditions, ending with the cold Younger Dryas. The effects of the cold periods may have been more severe in the vicinity of the Atlantic Ocean than in continental Europe. We use pollen percentage and influx data combined with data on substrate and relief to reconstruct spatially explicit vegetation composition, patterns and development during the Younger Dryas, with special focus on to the forest/non-forest transition across NE Germany. Opposing trends, such as birch pollen percentages sharply increasing but accumulation rates sharply decreasing northwards, underline pitfalls in the interpretation of pollen percentage data in tree-line situations. The combined approach reveals a sharp ecotone. Pine declined on northern sites, possibly because of permafrost formation, but was hardly affected in the south. Birch also declined in the south, possibly because of the severe winter cold. Cold-adapted trees did not enter forest gaps. The cooling had little impact on herbal vegetation. Steppe elements (grasses, Artemisia) were largely restricted to south-exposed slopes and did not benefit from the cooling patches of steppe vegetation were even less abundant than during the preceding warm periods. The approach of combining fossil pollen data, including accumulation rates, with data on the contemporary distribution of substrate and relief allowed unprecedented spatial resolution to be reached in the reconstruction of Younger Dryas vegetation patterns.																			0300-9483	1502-3885				JUL	2012	41	3					391	407		10.1111/j.1502-3885.2011.00240.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1502-3885.2011.00240.x													WOS:000305561200005

Spread of a subtropical Australian ant, Ochetellus glaber clarithorax (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), in central Florida	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY												Ochetellus glaber clarithorax is an ant native to humid subtropical areas of Queensland and New South Wales in eastern Australia. In 1979, a non-native population of O. glaber was reported from Winter Park, in Orange County, Florida. Since then, there have been several other O. glaber site records in Florida, all from Orange County, except one from neighboring Lake County. In 2019-2020, I collected this species, which I identify as Ochetellus glaber clarithorax, at 17 sites in east-central Florida, ranging in latitude from 28.3 degrees N-29.8 degrees N, all from sites with a humid subtropical climate. These include the first site records of this of O. glaber clarithorax suggest that populations are expanding northward and eastward, but not southward. Ochetellus glaber clarithorax is one of the few non-native ants in Florida not known from the more southern, tropical parts of the state. Ochetellus glaber clarithorax may only be able to successfully invade humid subtropical areas.																			0002-8320	2162-3139				FEB	2025	150	2					269	274																WOS:001456725800006
J	CHAPRA, SC				CHAPRA, SC			TOXICANT-LOADING CONCEPT FOR ORGANIC CONTAMINANTS IN LAKES	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING-ASCE												The analysis focuses on a steady-state budget model. To simplify the analysis, the mechanisms of decay and diffusive sediment feedback are ignored. These omissions result in a lower-bound representation of the net loss rate that is dependent on three processes: sorption, volatilization, and sediment resuspension. In order to investigate the interaction of these processes, the net loss rate is mapped on a space defined by sorption and volatilization dimensions. On this space, three zones are identified. The air zone contains substances that sorb weakly, are highly insoluble, and would exhibit high removal rates due to volatilization. At the other extreme, the water zone, substances that sorb weakly and are soluble have low removal rates because they are not subject to sedimentation or volatilization. The third area, the sediment zone, is populated by strong sorbers that are primarily governed by sediment resuspension. Among the organic priority pollutants, the halogenated aliphatics and most of the monocyclic aromatics reside in the air zone and should experience rapid purging. A significant number of pesticides, phenols, phthalate esters and nitrosamines fall in the water and sediment zones. These could represent problem compounds from the perspective of a weak assimilative capacity.

After the former Colibita resort was flooded by the reservoir, tourism in the area recorded a decades-long drawback, and only several private weekend cottages were erected around the lake. Eventually, after the fall of the communist regime, the area surrounding the lake was purchased by individuals or entrepreneurs who gradually built up one side of the reservoir and erected several cottages on the other. Thus, the access to the body of water is widely restricted to tourists, except the cases where lodging and dining facilities were established. The local economy depends on the region's natural resources, forestry, livestock breeding, milk processing, and traditional handicraft as the main activities. Therefore, a stronger tourist infrastructure (through a planned development of the future resort) is required to boost economy and to revitalise tourism in the region.

J	CROSSMAN, EJ				CROSSMAN, EJ			A PREDATOR PREY INTERACTION IN FRESHWATER FISH	JOURNAL OF THE FISHERIES RESEARCH BOARD OF CANADA												The predator-prey interaction of rainbow trout, Salmo gairdneri, and the redside shiner, Richardsonius balteatus in Paul Lake, British Columbia, depends on such factors as distribution and movements of predator and prey, behavior of predator and prey, lake morphometry, shoal water temperature and characteristics of the fish. In adult trout, activity associated with predation follows a stereotype pattern. Behavior also may be responsible for the fact that trout under 10 inches in length do not utilize, as food, even small shiners to any extent, even though under laboratory conditions they will kill and eat them. The estimated annual kill of shiners by predatory trout is 150,000 and the shiner population is probably in the millions. Shiners preyed on are such that predation appears not to limit recruitment to the prey population. Shortly after their introduction to the lake shiners reduced the growth rate of small trout by competition. There is evidence that feeding on shiners now increases the growth rate of at least those trout over 14 inches whose food is as high as 98% shiners in summer.																									1959	16	3					269	281		10.1139/f59-022	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f59-022													WOS:A1959WZ51900002

Understanding the response of vegetation to rapid temperature increase and human impact is necessary to produce accurate and reliable predictions of future mountain vegetation and mitigate climate change impacts. Our multiproxy study reconstructs climate, fire, and vegetation dynamics over the last 14,200 cal. BP at Lai da Vons (1991 m a.s.l.), a subalpine lake situated in the treeline ecotone in Eastern Switzerland. Our results based on geochemical analysis (XRF), pollen and charcoal analysis, and high-resolution macrofossil analysis reveal that early afforestation started already at the onset of the Holocene, dominated by Pinus cembra and Larix decidua. Larch and stone pine formed closed forests at the site at 10,300 cal. BP. From 9500 cal. BP onwards, when summer temperatures were warmer than today, Picea abies expanded simultaneously with Abies alba. In the past 6500 years, increasing human impact, culminating during two main phases of landscape opening and intensification of fire regime, led to a progressive increase of species richness. Considering future climate change, an upward shift of treeline and timberline is expected in the absence of domesticated herbivores. We advocate that low-intensity pastoralism in such a cultural landscape is essential to preserve the plant diversity of species-rich mountain meadows.

Intra- and inter-annual variability in metabolism in an oligotrophic lake	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Lakes are sentinels of change in the landscapes in which they are located. Changes in lake function are reflected in whole-system metabolism, which integrates ecosystem processes across spatial and temporal scales. Recent improvements in high-frequency open-water metabolism modeling techniques have enabled estimation of rates of gross primary production (GPP), respiration (R), and net ecosystem production (NEP) at high temporal resolution. However, few studies have examined metabolic rates over daily to multi-year temporal scales, especially in oligotrophic ecosystems. Here, we modified a metabolism modeling technique to reveal substantial intra- and inter-annual variability in metabolic rates in Lake Sunapee, a temperate, oligotrophic lake in New Hampshire, USA. Annual GPP and R increased each summer, paralleling increases in littoral, but not pelagic, total phosphorus concentrations. Storms temporarily decoupled GPP and R, resulting in greater decreases in GPP than R. Daily rates of GPP and R were positively correlated on warm days that had stable water columns, and metabolism model fits were best on warm, sunny days, indicating the importance of lake physics when evaluating metabolic rates. These metabolism data span a range of temporal scales and together suggest that Lake Sunapee may be moving toward mesotrophy. We suggest that functional, integrative metrics, such as metabolic rates, are useful indicators and sentinels of ecosystem change. We also highlight the challenges and opportunities of using high-frequency measurements to elucidate the drivers and consequences of intra- and inter-annual variability in metabolic rates, especially in oligotrophic lakes.

Species composition and densities of pelagic larval fishes were assessed with towed plankton nets at three embayments and adjacent nearshore habitats located along the New York shore, two sites in 1997 and a third site in 1998. Peak nearshore densities of larval alewives in 1997 and 1998 were compared to 1977 and 1978, a time period prior to major phosphorus reductions and the establishment of exotic dreissenid mussels in Lake Ontario. Seasonal changes in the pelagic larval fish assemblage were generally similar in the embayments; yellow perch (Perca flavescens) were prevalent in late-May shifting to co-occurrence of alewives and Lepomis spp. in June and July. At all nearshore sites, the larval fish assemblage throughout summer consisted mainly of alewives (> 65%). Densities of larval alewives peaked earlier in embayments but generally at lower densities than observed later in the nearshore. Because the amount of nearshore habitat greatly exceeds that of embayment habitat in Lake Ontario, nearshore waters served as the principal nurseries for larval alewives. However, densities of all larval fish species other than alewives (principally yellow perch and Lepomis spp.) were usually greater in embayments than the nearshore. Compared to three nearshore sites in 1977 and 1978, timing of peak densities of alewives in 1997 and 1998 were similar and temperature dependent; highest densities occurred in late July to early August after nearshore waters were greater than or equal to 18degreesC. Peak median nearshore alewife densities (larvae/100 m(3)) in 1997 (47) and 1998 (60) were similar to those in 1977 (8 to 100) and 1978 (34 to 49). This similarity suggested a limited effect of lowered phosphorus and food web changes on peak larval alewife densities in Lake Ontario.																			0380-1330						2003	29	1					181	198		10.1016/S0380-1330(03)70426-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(03)70426-2													WOS:000181997000017
J	Christianson, KR; Johnson, BM				Christianson, Kyle R.; Johnson, Brett M.			Combined effects of early snowmelt and climate warming on mountain lake temperatures and fish energetics	ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												Mountain regions are experiencing some of the highest air temperature increases and ice cover decreases. However, few studies have examined the effects of climate warming and earlier snowmelt on mountain lake thermal characteristics and energetic implications for fish. We assessed potential climate-induced thermal changes and energetic consequences for cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii spp.) and brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) in the Southern Rocky Mountains, United States. We found that summer growing degree days increased by an average 21 percent with 2 degrees C air warming and 43 percent with 5 degrees C air warming. But earlier snowmelt increased growing degree days by an average 48 percent. The average maintenance ration with 2 degrees C and 5 degrees C warming increased respectively by 13.8 and 21.9 percent for cutthroat trout and 23.8 and 37.4 percent for brook trout. The average increase in food required with earlier snowmelt was 43.4 percent for cutthroat trout and 52.3 percent for brook trout. Thus, earlier snowmelt can have a greater effect on fish energy requirements than a 5 degrees C rise in air temperatures. Snowmelt recession together with a 5 degrees C air temperature rise could more than double food requirements for fish to maintain constant body weight. If lake productivity increases with these climatic changes, then trout growth could improve; otherwise, energetic demands may result in lower fish growth.																			1523-0430	1938-4246				JAN 1	2020	52	1					130	145		10.1080/15230430.2020.1741199	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15230430.2020.1741199													WOS:000529452300001

We combine these data with backstripping techniques to provide a minimum estimate of the Messinian sea level fall in the EBRO Margin, as well as coupled isostasy and river incision and transport modeling to offer new constraints on the evolution of the adjacent subaerial Ebro Basin. Four major seismic units are identified on the Cenozoic Ebro Margin, based on the seismic data, including two major prograding megasequences that are separated by a major unconfirmity: the MES. The 3D seismic data provide an unprecedented view of the MES and display characteristic features of subaerial incision, including a drainage network with tributaries of at least five different orders, terraces and meandering rivers. The Messinian landscape presents a characteristic stepped-like profile that allows the margin to be subdivided in three different regions roughly parallel to the coastline. No major tectonic control exists on the boundaries between these regions. The boundary between the two most distal regions marks the location of a relatively stable base level, and this is used in backstripping analysis to estimate the magnitude of sea level drop associated with the Messinian Salinity Crisis on the Ebro Margin. The MES on the Ebro Margin is dominated by a major fluvial system, that we identify here as the Messinian Ebro River. The 3D seismic data, onshore geology and modeling results indicate that the Ebro River drained the Ebro Basin well in advance of the Messinian.

J	Roeser, P; Franz, SO; Litt, T				Roeser, Patricia; Franz, Sven O.; Litt, Thomas			Aragonite and calcite preservation in sediments from Lake Iznik related to bottom lake oxygenation and water column depth	SEDIMENTOLOGY												This study examines the forcing mechanisms driving long-term carbonate accumulation and preservation in lacustrine sediments in Lake Iznik (northwestern Turkey) since the last glacial. Currently, carbonates precipitate during summer from the alkaline water column, and the sediments preserve aragonite and calcite. Based on X-ray diffraction data, carbonate accumulation has changed significantly and striking reversals in the abundance of the two carbonate polymorphs have occurred on a decadal time scale, during the last 31 ka cal BP. Different lines of evidence, such as grain size, organic matter and redox sensitive elements, indicate that reversals in carbonate polymorph abundance arise due to physical changes in the lacustrine setting, for example, water column depth and lake mixing. The aragonite concentrations are remarkably sensitive to climate, and exhibit millennial-scale oscillations. Extending observations from modern lakes, the Iznik record shows that the aerobic decomposition of organic matter and sulphate reduction are also substantial factors in carbonate preservation over long time periods. Lower lake levels favour aragonite precipitation from supersaturated waters. Prolonged periods of stratification and, consequently, enhanced sulphate reduction favour aragonite preservation. In contrast, prolonged or repeated exposure of the sediment-water interface to oxygen results in in situ aerobic organic matter decomposition, eventually leading to carbonate dissolution. Notably, the Iznik sediment profile raises the hypothesis that different states of lacustrine mixing lead to selective preservation of different carbonate polymorphs. Thus, a change in the entire lake water chemistry is not strictly necessary to favour the preservation of one polymorph over another. Therefore, this investigation is a novel contribution to the carbon cycle in lacustrine systems.

The soils below the disturbed forest received 2-6 times more elements via litter fall compared to the unaffected plot. The subsequent decomposition of litter and reduced nutrient uptake by trees resulted in a steep increase in soil concentrations of soluble N (NH4-N, organic-bound N) and P forms in the disturbed plot. The average concentrations of NH4-N and soluble reactive P increased from 0.8 to 4.4 mmol kg(-1) and from 0.04 to 0.9 mmol kg(-1), respectively, in the uppermost soil horizon. Decomposition of litter at the disturbed plot elevated soil concentrations of Ca2+, Mg2+ and K+, which replaced Al3+ and H+ ions from the soil sorption complex. Consequently, soil concentrations of exchangeable base cations increased from 120 to 200 meq kg(-1), while exchangeable Al3+ and H+ decreased 66 and 50 %, respectively, and soil base saturation increased from 40 to 70 %. The Al3+ liberation did not elevate concentrations of ionic Al in the soil solution, because most of the liberated Al3+ was rapidly complexed by dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and transformed to DOC-Al complexes. The chemical parameters investigated at the unaffected plot remained stable during the study.

The substantial decreasing of monsoon strength in the East Asian monsoon region during the H1, as shown by stalagmite delta O-18 records, has been attributed to the southward shift of the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ), which is caused by the slowdown/collapse of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC). However, records from different Asian monsoon regions show various trends in precipitation changes during the H1, and these trends cannot be solely interpreted by the southward shift of the ITCZ. In the present study, we reconstructed time-series of East Asian monsoon precipitation between 25,000 and 10,000 a BP from floodplain sediments in the Huai River Basin. A white sediment layer, distinct from other layers in the profile, contains significantly low TOC, tree pollen and fern spore contents, and more positive delta C-13(org), and it is deposited during the H1 event. The determined TOC, pollen and delta C-13(org) time series, together with previously reported stalagmite 5180, indicate a catastrophic (severe) drought in Jianghuai Region, one of the East Asian monsoon regions, during the H1. The La Nina condition in tropical Pacific likely also contributes to the catastrophic drought in Jianghuai Region and the precipitation variations in the Asian monsoon region during the H1.

J	Rahman, A; Sarkar, S; Kumar, S				Rahman, Abdur; Sarkar, Siddhartha; Kumar, Sanjeev			Paleoenvironment of the Central Himalaya during late MIS 3 using stable isotopic compositions of lacustrine organic matter occluded in diatoms and sediments	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 3 was an interstadial stage in the climate history of the Earth where the last phase (40-30 ka) showed relatively warmer climate over the northwest China, Tibetan Plateau, and northwestern India compared to other regions of the world. However, not many studies are reported for climate variability during this period from the Himalayan region. Here, an attempt has been made to understand the paleoenvironment of the Central Himalaya during 45-29 ka using stable isotopic compositions of carbon (delta C-13(TOC)) and nitrogen (delta N-15(TN)) along with their elemental ratios (TOC/TN) in bulk organic matter and occluded organic matter within diatom frustules (delta C-13(Di)atom) of a paleolake sequence. The variabilities in delta C-13(Di)atom, delta C-13(TOC), and TOC/TN ratios indicated intermittent changes in the lake carbon dynamics from bicarbonate dominated system to carbon dioxide dominated regime. These changes in lacustrine carbon cycling provided evidence for existence of sporadic dry events in the Central Himalaya during 45-29 ka. In agreement with the records from the northwest China, Tibetan Plateau, and northwestern India, our results also confirm the existence of a relatively wet and humid period during 40-32 ka in the Central Himalaya. Therefore, it appeared that compared to other parts of the world, relatively wet and humid climate existed throughout this region. However, the mechanism behind this wet and humid phase remains to be explored and warrants a high resolution paleoclimate study in the Himalaya.

JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Declining lake levels (Aral Sea syndrome) can be caused by changes in climate, increased water use or changed regulation patterns. This paper introduces a novel lake geometry index (LGI) to quantify lake hydrological characteristics. The index was developed using a large representative dataset of lake hypsographic characteristics from 152 lakes and man-made reservoirs. Using the LGI index, lakes can be classified into five groups: groups 1-4 when LGI is 0.5-2.5, 2.5-4.5, 4.5-6.5 and 6.5-8.5, respectively, and group 5 when LGI is >8.5. Naturally shallow and vast lakes and wetlands fall into the first group and deep man-made reservoirs in narrow valleys are in group 5. The response of three different lake systems (LGI 0.75, 2.75 and 6.5) to different water flow scenarios was then simulated using the water balance equation. From this, the index 'potential lake area' (A(pot)) was developed to show lake responses to changed hydro-climatological conditions. A(pot) and LGI can be used to classify lakes into open or closed systems. Simulations showed that lakes with low LGI have a shorter response time to flow and climate changes. As a result, the impact of water balance restoration is faster for lakes with low LGI than for lakes with high LGI. The latter are also more vulnerable to climate variation and change.

In June all ovaries were either in spawning condition or very close to this stage; by Sept. all were completely spent. Between June and Sept. the average ovary of an age-group-II female decreased in wet weight from 8.7 to 1.9 g, a decrease of 6.8 g (2.5 g dry weight). Protein accounted for 1.7 g of the decrease in dry weight whereas fat accounted for about 0.7 g. These losses are compared with the body weight of the fish and annual growth by individuals. Protein loss as spent ova was calculated to be about 13% of the total somatic protein of a spawning female and about 24% of the somatic protein gained by the fish as annual growth during the previous year. The substantial losses of protein as spent gametes are discussed relative to estimates of production by freshwater fish populations.																			0012-9658	1939-9170					1967	48	6					1017	+		10.2307/1934556	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1934556													WOS:A1967A465800026

Holocene mass movements in west and mid-Norwegian fjords and lakes	MARINE GEOLOGY												In this study, identified mass transport deposits (MTDs) in previously analyzed as well as new sediment cores and seismic profiles from 22 fjord systems and six lakes in west and mid-Norway are compiled in order to close knowledge gaps in the understanding of how mass movements relate to seismic activity and climatic changes affecting the sedimentary systems. A total of 125 postglacial MTDs have been identified and dated in the studied systems. Mass movement frequency plots suggest high mass movement activity for two periods in the Early Holocene (11,000-9700 and 8300-7700 cal. yrs BP), a quiescent period in the mid-Holocene, and a mass movement reactivation at similar to 4200 cal. yrs BP. The evaluation of trigger mechanisms makes us infer that some of the mass movements identified are most likely related to climatic processes and tsunamis. However, most of the events seem to be caused by regional seismic activity, resulting in failure of climatically-preconditioned slopes. We suggest that at least 36 individual regional earthquakes (M > 6) have occurred in west and mid-Norway through the Holocene. Earthquake recurrence rates of 1/80 years are estimated for the period directly after the last deglaciation (similar to 12,800-11,600 cal. yrs BP), 1/200 years for the Early Holocene and 1/200 years for the last 4000 years of the Holocene time period. Comparisons with studies from other previously glaciated settings indicate that both Scandinavia and the Alps show similar trends as west and mid-Norway, but not Eastern Canada. This most likely reflects a later deglaciation of the Laurentide Ice Sheet.

Here we present an astronomically calibrated chronology for the Mediterranean Messinian age based on an integrated high-resolution stratigraphy and 'tuning' of sedimentary cycle patterns to variations in the Earth's orbital parameters. We show that the onset of the Messinian. salinity crisis is synchronous over the entire Mediterranean basin, dated at 5.96 +/- 0.02 million years ago. Isolation from the Atlantic Ocean was established between 5.59 and 5.33 million years ago, causing a large fall in Mediterranean water level followed by erosion (5.59-550 million years ago) and deposition (5.50-5.33 million years ago) of non-marine sediments in a large 'Lago Mare' (Lake Sea) basin. Cyclic evaporite deposition is almost entirely related to circum-Mediterranean climate changes driven by changes in the earth's precession, and not to obliquity-induced glacio-eustatic sea-level changes. We argue in favour of a dominantly tectonic origin for the Messinian salinity crisis, although its exact timing may well have been controlled by the similar to 400-kyr component of the Earths eccentricity cycle.					; Sierro, Francisco/A-4714-2008; Raffi, Isabella/AAY-5505-2020	Krijgsman, Wout/0000-0002-1472-1074; Sierro, Francisco/0000-0002-8647-456X; Hilgen, Frits/0000-0002-5683-259X; 													0028-0836					AUG 12	1999	400	6745					652	655		10.1038/23231	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/23231													WOS:000082032900049
J	DeCatanzaro, R; Chow-Fraser, P				DeCatanzaro, Rachel; Chow-Fraser, Patricia			Relationship of road density and marsh condition to turtle assemblage characteristics in the Laurentian Great Lakes	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Human-induced degradation of coastal wetlands often leads to altered trophic dynamics and species assemblages. Here we use data from 77 coastal marshes in three Laurentian Great Lakes collected between 2001 and 2007 to examine the relationship between human disturbance (road density and wetland quality) and characteristics of aquatic turtle assemblages, including species richness and abundances. Painted turtles (Chrysemys picta) were encountered disproportionately in degraded wetlands and the probability of occurrence decreased with improved site quality. Abundance of painted turtles peaked, however, at intermediate road density in surrounding 1- and 2-km buffers. Across all sites, species richness was highest and common snapping turtles (Chelydra serpentina) were most abundant in wetlands with intermediate water quality. The common musk turtle (Sternotherus odoratus) was absent from degraded wetlands in the lower lakes (Erie and Ontario) that fell within their historical range, but reached high abundances in marshes of Georgian Bay and the North Channel, a region with relatively low human disturbance. Analysis of sex ratios in painted turtles revealed a significant male bias in an area with high road density, while the sex ratio did not differ significantly from 1:1 in a less developed region, consistent with reports of high female mortality in urban areas.

The cold surge frequency was higher (lower) in 1957-1977 (1981-2001), which corresponded to the negative (positive) phase of the NAO. The teleconnection pattern associated with the NAO suggests that the Siberian high, the ridge upstream of Lake Baikal and the East Asian trough, which are well-known circulation characteristics favorable for cold surge occurrences, were enhanced in the negative NAO phase. A weakened upper-level convergence over the Mediterranean-Sahara occurring in the negative NAO phase was associated with a wave-like pattern spreading toward East Asia along the subtropical jet stream. Barotropic modeling results suggest that the suppressed upper-level convergence in the Mediterranean-Sahara region may force a wave train emanating toward East Asia along the subtropical jet stream, which acts as a Rossby waveguide. The barotropic wave pattern may result in a stronger low-level northerly over subtropical East Asia and create a favorable background for the further southward penetration of cold air, and therefore more frequent cold surge occurrence. The same process may be applied to the period when the NAO is in the positive phase. Citation: Hong, C.-C., H.-H. Hsu, H.-H. Chia, and C.-Y.

Two stratigraphic intervals were modeled and simulated for geothermal heat production systems: conventional and closed loop. We estimated that 2.93 MWth and 6.9 MWth heat energy can be generated over 30 years of operation in the Mesozoic (300-500 m depth; 100 m thickness, 16 degrees C reservoir temperature, 1 D permeability, 0.3 porosity, 180 m3/h flow rate, 800 m well spacing) and Paleozoic (1400-1200 m depth, 100 m thickness, 35 degrees C reservoir temperature, 10 mD permeability, 0.1 porosity, a 180 m3/h flow rate, 400 m spacing) respectively.

Hydrographic maintenance of deep anoxia in a tidally influenced saline lagoon	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Low dissolved oxygen concentrations are of increasing concern in aquatic ecosystems, particularly at the interface between freshwater and marine environments. Oxygen depletion occurs naturally in many perennially stratified systems and it remains to be seen how climate change will affect these habitats. This is due, in part, to a lack of highresolution, long-term data describing interannual variability in dissolved oxygen concentrations within stratified basins. Physicochemical parameters for Lough Furnace, an ecologically important tidal lagoon, were assessed using daily measurements (2009-14) from an undulating CTD (conductivity, temperature and depth) profiler and observations of tidal exchange flow. Continuous vertical saline stratification existed, with anoxia (<0.1 mg L-1) typically persisting below 6 m. Tidal inflows were generally restricted, with deep-water renewal events by intrusions of denser spring tidal water occurring episodically (three times in 6 years), following prolonged periods of low freshwater input. Although wind forcing alone was not sufficient to generate basin-scale mixing, the conditions that led to deep-water renewals may also be conducive to wind-driven upwelling events in nearshore areas. These findings have wider application to larger-scale two-layered stratified systems with deep anoxia because the ability to forecast such dynamic events is important for assessing the ecological implications of dissolved oxygen depletion.						white, martin/0000-0003-3271-1221; de Eyto, Elvira/0000-0003-2281-2491; Brett, Gemma Marie/0000-0001-8249-2675													1323-1650	1448-6059					2018	69	3					432	445		10.1071/MF17199	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MF17199													WOS:000426049200009

An evaluation of statistical models of microcystin detection in lakes applied forward under varying climate conditions	HARMFUL ALGAE												Algal blooms can threaten human health if cyanotoxins such as microcystin are produced by cyanobacteria. Regularly monitoring microcystin concentrations in recreational waters to inform management action is a tool for protecting public health; however, monitoring cyanotoxins is resource- and time-intensive. Statistical models that identify waterbodies likely to produce microcystin can help guide monitoring efforts, but variability in bloom severity and cyanotoxin production among lakes and years makes prediction challenging. We evaluated the skill of a statistical classification model developed from water quality surveys in one season with low temporal replication but broad spatial coverage to predict if microcystin is likely to be detected in a lake in subsequent years. We used summertime monitoring data from 128 lakes in Iowa (USA) sampled between 2017 and 2021 to build and evaluate a predictive model of microcystin detection as a function of lake physical and chemical attributes, watershed characteristics, zooplankton abundance, and weather. The model built from 2017 data identified pH, total nutrient concentrations, and ecogeographic variables as the best predictors of microcystin detection in this population of lakes. We then applied the 2017 classification model to data collected in subsequent years and found that model skill declined but remained effective at predicting microcystin detection (area under the curve, AUC >= 0.7). We assessed if classification skill could be improved by assimilating the previous years' monitoring data into the model, but model skill was only minimally enhanced. Overall, the classification model remained reliable under varying climatic conditions. Finally, we tested if early season observations could be combined with a trained model to provide early warning for late summer microcystin detection, but model skill was low in all years and below the AUC threshold for two years. The results of these modeling exercises support the application of correlative analyses built on single-season sampling data to monitoring decision-making, but similar investigations are needed in other regions to build further evidence for this approach in management application.

J	Avery, E; Bibby, R; Visser, A; Esser, B; Moran, J				Avery, Elizabeth; Bibby, Richard; Visser, Ate; Esser, Bradley; Moran, Jean			Quantification of Groundwater Discharge in a Subalpine Stream Using Radon-222	WATER												During the dry months of the water year in Mediterranean climates, groundwater influx is essential to perennial streams for sustaining ecosystem health and regulating water temperature. Predicted earlier peak flow due to climate change may result in decreased baseflow and the transformation of perennial streams to intermittent streams. In this study, naturally occurring radon-222 (Rn-222) was used as a tracer of groundwater influx to Martis Creek, a subalpine stream near Lake Tahoe, CA. Groundwater Rn-222 is estimated based on measurements of Rn-222 activity in nearby deep wells and springs. To determine the degassing constant (needed for quantification of water and gas flux), an extrinsic tracer, xenon (Xe), was introduced to the stream and monitored at eight downstream locations. The degassing constant for Rn-222 is based on the degassing constant for Xe, and was determined to be 1.9-9.0 m/day. Applying a simple model in which stream Rn-222 activity is a balance between the main Rn-222 source (groundwater) and sink (volatilization), the influx in reaches of the upstream portion of Martis Creek was calculated to be <1 to 15 m(3)/day/m, which cumulatively constitutes a significant portion of the stream discharge. Experiments constraining Rn-222 emanation from hyporheic zone sediments suggest that this should be considered a maximum rate of influx. Groundwater influx is typically difficult to identify and quantify, and the method employed here is useful for identifying locations for focused stream flow measurements, for formulating a water budget, and for quantifying streamwater-groundwater interaction.					; Esser, Bradley/G-4283-2010; Visser, Ate/G-8826-2012	Bibby, Richard/0000-0003-1733-8916; Visser, Ate/0000-0003-4048-4540; 													2073-4441					FEB	2018	10	2							100	10.3390/w10020100	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w10020100													WOS:000426775500010

Field-scale demonstration of the potential for sewage to remediate acidic mine waters	MINE WATER AND THE ENVIRONMENT												Pit lake waters are often contaminated by acid mine drainage (AMD) from weathering of pyritic materials exposed by mining operations, leading to low pH, and high solute and heavy metal concentrations. Few cost-effective engineering solutions exist for large-scale environmental remediation of AMD-contaminated pit lakes. However, various studies have demonstrated that biological remediation strategies for remediating AMD-contaminated waters, including microbially-mediated sulphate reduction, show promise at the laboratory-scale. The addition of acidic mine water to raw sewage and workshop wastewaters in an evaporation pond provided an opportunity for a field-scale experiment as essentially a reversal of suggested in-situ treatment of acidic pit lakes by addition of organic carbon. The hyper-eutrophic evaporation pond initially contained high concentrations of nutrients, a pH > 8, high levels of sulphate (500 mg L(-1)), and had regular algal blooms. Soon after the addition of the AMD pit water, the evaporation pond pH fell to 2.4, and electrical conductivity (EC) and most metal concentrations were elevated by one to two orders of magnitude. Over the following 18 months, the pH of the pond increased and the EC and metal concentrations decreased. After only 18 months of addition of AMD, pond water quality had returned to a level similar to that before AMD addition. These observations suggest that addition of low-grade organic materials shows promise for remediation of acid mine waters at field scale and warrants experimental investigation.

A slide down a slippery slope - alpine ecosystem responses to nitrogen deposition	PLANT ECOLOGY & DIVERSITY												Background: Nitrogen (N) deposition in the Front Range of the southern Rocky Mountains has been increasing for several decades, and has exceeded the critical load for several ecological metrics. Aims: Our objective was to predict potential future ecological changes in alpine zones in response to anthropogenic N deposition based on a review of research from Niwot Ridge, Colorado. Results: Empirical observations and experimental studies indicate that plant, algal and soil microbe species compositions are changing in response to N deposition, with nitrophilic species increasing in abundance. Biotic sequestration of N deposition is insufficient to compensate for greater nitrate production, leading to the potential for acidification and base cation loss. Conclusions: Changes in biotic composition in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems have important impacts on ecosystem functioning, including a lower capacity to take up and neutralise the acidifying effect of anthropogenic N, increasing phosphorus limitation of production in terrestrial and aquatic systems, and shifts in rates of N and carbon cycling. Continued elevated N deposition rates coupled with ongoing climate change, including warmer summer temperatures and lower snow cover of shorter duration, will influence the ecological thresholds for biotic and functional changes. We suggest that these thresholds will occur at lower inputs of N deposition under future climate change, meriting reconsideration of current N critical loads to protect sensitive alpine ecosystems.

Microclimatic Variability of Cold-Season Minimum Temperatures in Michigan, United States: A Study with Implications for Insect Mortality	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY												Gridded climate datasets are used by researchers and practitioners in many disciplines, including forest ecology, agriculture, and entomology. However, such datasets are generally unable to account for microclimatic variability, particularly within sites or among individual trees. One such dataset is a recent climatology of extreme minimum temperatures in the U.S. Great Lakes region, based on the Parameter-Elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) gridded temperature dataset. Development of this climatology was motivated by interest in the spatiotemporal variability of winter temperatures potentially lethal to the hemlock woolly adelgid (HWA) (Adelges tsugae Annand) (Hemiptera: Adelgidae), an invasive insect that causes mortality of eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis). In this study, cold-season daily minimum temperatures were monitored at six Michigan sites varying in latitude, elevation, Great Lakes proximity, and HWA infestation status, to address two objectives. First, we documented the spatiotemporal variability in daily minimum air temperatures recorded at multiple aspects and heights on selected hemlock trees. Second, this variability was characterized in the context of the PRISM extreme minimum temperature climatology. Tree-sensor air temperatures exhibited minimal relationships with aspect but considerable sensitivity to height. Daily minimum temperatures were higher for some tree sensors positioned # 0.2 m above ground level during some time periods, with overall muted temporal variability, relative to an adjacent ambient sensor. This phenomenon was attributed to the insulating effects of snow cover, because the tree-ambient sensor temperature difference was positively correlated with snow depth. Overall, results indicate that such unresolved variability warrants consideration by gridded climate dataset users.																			1558-8424	1558-8432				SEP	2023	62	9					1187	1203		10.1175/JAMC-D-23-0067.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JAMC-D-23-0067.1													WOS:001063458700002

This is especially true for cities and urban areas. However, for an operator, the ship Oper-ation Time Window (OTW) is important in order to predict possible business cases, especially for regions with long-term winter seasons with icy conditions. The OTW indicates the probable number of navigable days for the ship. The operability is in relation with ship speed, ice thickness, whereas the ship resistance is of significant relevance. This study proposes a model to investigate the possibility of a certain operating condition for ice-going ships based on an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model and a statistical model. To demonstrate the proposed method for calculating the ship OTW of an IWW, a case study is performed. Ice condition in Lake Ma center dot laren (in Sweden) and an IWW ship designed to maximise its dimension restrictions are used for this case. The Radial Basis Function-Particle swarm optimization (RBF-PSO) ANN model is used to predict ice resistance in level ice con-ditions. Given the ice resistance prediction, a statistical analysis is further conducted regarding to the ice thickness distribution and the operational ship speed distribution to obtain ship OTW. Comparisons are made between semi-empirical ice resistance prediction methods and the ANN model. The influence of different ship speed distribution profiles is investigated by performing a parametric study. The OTW model can be used to evaluate ship operational scenarios in ice-covered waters for ship designers and owners.

Desulfuribacillus stibiiarsenatis sp nov., an obligately anaerobic, dissimilatory antimonate- and arsenate-reducing bacterium isolated from anoxic sediments, and emended description of the genus Desulfuribacillus	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SYSTEMATIC AND EVOLUTIONARY MICROBIOLOGY												A novel anaerobic, Gram-stain-negative, endospore-forming bacterium, designated strain MLFW-2(T),was isolated from anoxic sediments collected from the drainage area of a geothermal spring near Mono Lake, CA, USA. Optimal growth was achieved at 34 degrees C and pH 8.25-8.50 in medium containing 0.75% (w/v) NaCl. Catalase, but not oxidase, was produced. Strain MLFW-2(T) was an obligate anaerobe capable of respiring with nitrate, nitrite, DMSO, arsenate, antimonate, selenate and selenite as terminal electron acceptors. Lactate, pyruvate, formate and H-2 could serve as electron donors to support growth. The isolate was incapable of fermentation. The predominant fatty acids were C-16:0, C-16:1 omega 9c, C-16:1 omega 7c, C-18:1 omega 9c and C-18:1 omega 7c. The major polar lipids were phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylethanolamine. The only isoprenoid quinone detected was menaquinone 7 (MK-7). The DNA G+C content was 38.2 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence demonstrated that strain MLFW-2(T) was a member of the order Bacillales and was most closely related to Desulfuribacillus alkaliarsenatis AHT28(T) (93.9% similarity). On the basis of phenotypic and phylogenomic evidence, strain MLFW-2(T) represents a novel species of the genus Desulfuribacillus, for which the name Desulfuribacillus stibiiarsenatis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is MLFW-2(T) (= DSM 28709(T) = JCM 30866(T)).

Four paddy waters generated from a pot experiment with different soil types collected from open paddy fields in northeast China were used in this study. A total of 438 DNA pol clones were identified as cyanopodoviruses. The clones from the paddy waters formed nine unique groups of cyanopodoviruses either exclusively or with clones from East Lake in China (subclusters alpha-1 to alpha-8 and cluster beta). None of the clones from open oceans or coastal waters fell into these unique groups. Additionally, the distribution proportions of the clones into different cyanopodovirus groups varied among paddy water samples, which suggested that the cyanopodovirus compositions were spatially distributed in the paddy fields. The comparison of clone libraries in different studies indicated that the diversity of cyanopodoviruses in paddy waters was comparable to the diversity in the open oceans but was less than the diversity in the coastal estuary of Chesapeake Bay. Non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis indicated that the cyanopodovirus communities in paddy waters were similar to those in lake freshwater but distinct from the communities in marine and coastal waters.

The common crane is the best known, although 72% of Spain's bird species can be seen in this lake. The exceptional location of the Gallocanta basin and the variety of its ecosystems favour the concentration of steppe birds, water birds, shorebirds. The annual and interannual variability of birds depends on fluctuations in the lake. The main concentration of aquatic birds occurs in winter, when water levels are high. During the 1998-1999 period, 10 121 Common Crane specimens gathered at the lake, and as many as 60 000 stopped here while migrating. In years with low rains, the lake frequently dries resulting in a significant decrease in the number of birds. On such occasions, the least demanding birds in terms of environmental conditions predominate, like the Anatidae. The decreasing trend in lake water level since the 1990s has dramatically lowered the number of water birds. For the time being, the specific diversity has not been affected.

A deeper understanding of how carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions are impacted in urban waters is important for quantifying the contributions of urban waters to the global carbon budget. Acidic polysaccharides (APS) are a major component of the carbon pool, though there is still much uncertainty associated with CO 2 concentrations and fluxes. Here, we measured the dissolved APS (DAPS), particulate APS (PAPS), and CO 2 concentrations and fluxes in a typical urban river (the Ganjiang River) and two lakes (Xiang Lake and Qingshan Lake) in China, and assessed the impact of different APS fractions on CO 2 concentrations and fluxes. Our results show abundant DAPS and PAPS in urban waters, with PAPS being the main form in winter while DAPS the main component in other seasons. The Ganjiang River and the urban lakes were supersaturated with CO 2 at concentrations of 35.67 +/- 19.99 mu mol & sdot; L - 1 & 27.79 +/- 17.52 mu mol & sdot; L - 1 and emissions of 64.52 +/- 53.38 mmol & sdot; (m 2 d) -1 & 36.56 +/- 56.97 mmol & sdot; (m 2 d) -1 from river and lake waters, respectively. Linear mixed -effects model analysis further revealed that increased DAPS concentration led to significantly higher CO 2 concentrations and fluxes, whereas PAPS exhibited a negative influence on CO 2 concentrations and fluxes in the urban lakes. Our work provides deeper insight into CO 2 evasion in inland freshwater ecosystems as well as carbon neutrality in urban waters.

J	Dessborn, L; Elmberg, J; Englund, G				Dessborn, Lisa; Elmberg, Johan; Englund, Goran			Pike predation affects breeding success and habitat selection of ducks	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												P>1. Fish and ducks often belong to the same local food web, and several studies indicate that there is a general negative effect of fish on breeding ducks. This pattern has so far been addressed mainly within the framework of competition for common invertebrate prey, while predation by large fish as a force behind settlement and abundance patterns in ducks remains largely unknown. This is the first study to address the effect of fish predation on breeding ducks, isolated from that of competition, and the first experiment to explore the ability of ducks to identify and avoid lakes with high risk of fish predation. 2. We used a before-after control-impact design and 11 naturally fishless lakes. Waterfowl on the lakes were surveyed during the breeding season of 2005. Large adult pike (Esox lucius) were added to two lakes in early spring 2008, and waterfowl surveys were repeated on all 11 lakes. 3. Pike introduction did not affect the number of pairs on lakes during the nesting season in any of three focal duck species (mallard Anas platyrhynchos, teal Anas crecca, and goldeneye Bucephala clangula). During the brood-rearing season, however, there was a decrease in duck days in teal and goldeneye in lakes with pike, with similar trends observed in mallard. The number of goldeneye ducklings was also significantly lower in lakes with pike. We were unable to determine whether the response was attributable to direct pike predation or to broods leaving experimental lakes, but in either case, our study demonstrates high fitness costs for ducks breeding on lakes with pike. 4. The apparent inability of nesting ducks to detect pike and the clear fitness implications may influence the annual recruitment of ducks on a larger scale as pike are both common and widespread. Vegetation complexity and food abundance are likely to be of overriding importance when breeding ducks are choosing a nesting site. As pike have a strong influence on breeding birds, relying on vegetation and cues of food abundance, while ignoring indicators of predation risk from fish, could lead to lakes with pike acting as an ecological trap.

J	Amano, T; Ushiyama, K; Higuchi, H				Amano, Tatsuya; Ushiyama, Katsumi; Higuchi, Hiroyoshi			Methods of Predicting Risks of Wheat Damage by White-Fronted Geese	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Accurately predicting occurrence of wildlife damage is crucial for effective management of problematic wildlife species, because accurate predication allows deterrence efforts to be focused at sites or times where damage is most likely. We explored methods to predict occurrence of white-fronted geese (Anser albifrons) grazing in wheat fields around Lake Miyajimanuma, Japan. Depletion of waste rice grains caused geese to forage on wheat leaves in spring, reducing wheat harvest in grazed fields. The cumulative number of goose-days per hectare of rice-planted area from the beginning of the staging period explained the variation in the proportion of geese foraging in wheat fields. A logistic regression model on the location of vulnerable fields showed that goose grazing was likely to occur in wheat fields far from roads and windbreaks and those close to (within 1,000-2,000 m of) previously grazed fields. Although probability of occurrence of goose grazing was initially low in wheat fields with scaring devices, effectiveness of such devices was lost over the 4 survey years. We recommend farmers in the study area prepare counter-damage measures when the cumulative number of goose-days per rice-planted area approaches a threshold above which some geese are predicted to start foraging on wheat (e. g., 199.46 goose-days/ ha rice +/- 28.95 for 10% of geese foraging on wheat). Further, farmers should be aware that grazing on wheat is more likely to occur if wheat fields within 1,000-2,000 m have already been exploited during that particular season and should concentrate deterrence efforts to wheat fields that are far from roads and windbreaks. Systematic deployment of scaring devices over the entire habitat has a risk of accelerating the decline in effectiveness. Thus, we need methods to retard goose habituation to scaring devices, such as scaring with guns, providing alternative feeding sites, and preventing diet change by geese.

J	Wang, XM; Tong, SL; Wang, Y; Ma, LJ; Shi, XM				Wang, Xiaoming; Tong, Shilu; Wang, Yu; Ma, Lijuan; Shi, Xiaoming			Climate Change, Cryosphere Retreat, and Human Health	CHINA CDC WEEKLY												The cryosphere, encompassing glaciers, ice sheets, permafrost, and snow, plays a critical role in regulating climate and sustaining human wellbeing. However, climate change is driving widespread cryosphere degradation, intensifying geophysical and climate-related hazards that pose escalating risks to the public health and safety. The resulting decline in both the quantity and quality of cryosphere services also has severe consequences, particularly for populations in polar regions, high-altitude mountains, and their downstream areas. Furthermore, teleconnected climate systems can even extend cryosphere change impacts beyond these regions. It has been seen that increasing cryosphere-related hazards, such as glacial lake outburst floods and extreme winter events, heighten public health risks. Disrupted meltwater supply and ecosystem shifts inflict water and food insecurity in arid and semiarid regions, exacerbating malnutrition and disease burdens. Additionally, thawing permafrost may release ancient pathogens and toxic substances, increasing the risks of infectious disease outbreaks and severe environmental contamination. Addressing these cascading risks requires urgent interdisciplinary research, public awareness, and investment in adaptive strategies to strengthen societal resilience amid a rapidly changing cryosphere and safeguard public well-being.

J	Desloges, JR; Gilbert, R				Desloges, JR; Gilbert, R			Sedimentation in Chilko Lake: a record of the geomorphic environment of the eastern Coast Mountains of British Columbia, Canada	GEOMORPHOLOGY												Chilko Lake is the largest and deepest lake draining the Coast Mountains of British Columbia. A sedimentary record from the 60-km long lake was constructed by using 3.5-Hz subbottom acoustic profiles and short cores of surface sediments. Sediment accumulation since deglaciation is remarkably thin, averaging less than 10 m, except in the central deep part of the lake, despite extensive activity of Holocene and modem glaciers in the 1960-km(2) contributing watershed. Sediment focusing of silts and clays in the main part of the lake occurs mainly by overflow/interflow processes from the Edmond and Nine Mile/Deschamps drainages. Sandy turbidites from these drainages and other smaller streams, however, extend for several kilometers into the lake basin. Distinct laminae in short cores from the central lake suggest that modern rates of deposition reach a maximum of 2.2 mm a(-1). Pb-210 dating and inferences from the acoustic results, however, indicate a lake-wide, long-term average rate of less than 1 mm a(-1), which is equivalent to a specific sediment yield of about 80 t km(-2) a(-1). This specific yield is amongst the lowest for glacier-fed lakes of the southern Canadian Cordillera. A low sediment supply can be related to three factors: (1) a much drier climate on the leeward side of the Coast Mountains producing lower specific discharges; (2) fewer autumn rainstorms that affect mainly lakes west of the Coast Mountains and (3) opportunities for storage of sediment in the lower 20 km of Edmond River, which drains the most heavily glacierized portion of the watershed.

RADIOCARBON												To elucidate the dynamics of terrestrial leaf waxes in a high-altitude lake system, we performed compound-specific radiocarbon analysis (CSRA) of long-chain n-alkanes in two sediment core sections from Lake Karakul (Pamirs, Tajikistan) and in surface soil samples from the catchment area. We aimed to answer the question whether the n-alkanes are delivered into the lake sediment with substantial delay due to storage in soils, which may cause a potential bias when used as paleoenvironmental proxies. In the surface soils, the CSRA results reveal an age range of n-alkanes from modern to 2278 +/- 155 cal BP. In the two sediment core samples, three of the four n-alkane ages fell on the lower ends of the 1 sigma-uncertainty ranges of modeled ages of the sediments (based on AMS C-14-TOC and OSL dating results). We conclude that sedimentary leaf waxes represent compounds with intermediate turnover time in soils, for example originating from alluvial plains close to the shores. Overall, the results provide evidence that sedimentary leaf wax compounds in this cold and arid setting are potentially older than the conventional age model indicates, but these findings need to be interpreted in context of the generally large uncertainty ranges of such age models.					; Mischke, Steffen/L-9300-2015; Sachse, Dirk/D-3410-2012; Suska-Malawska, Małgorzata/AAT-9188-2021; Aichner, Bernhard/AAH-1768-2020; Mętrak, Monika/HMO-6034-2023; Rethemeyer, Janet/G-4019-2013	Metrak, Monika/0000-0002-6069-6041; Suska-Malawska, Malgorzata/0000-0002-5400-9508; Mischke, Steffen/0000-0003-3821-8497; Aichner, Bernhard/0000-0002-2471-7466; Rethemeyer, Janet/0000-0001-6698-4186; Wilk, Mateusz/0000-0002-6400-7012													0033-8222	1945-5755				DEC	2021	63	6					1575	1590	PII S0033822221000783	10.1017/RDC.2021.78	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/RDC.2021.78													WOS:000742107000003

Long-term study of phytoplankton dynamics in a supply reservoir reveals signs of trophic state shift linked to changes in hydrodynamics associated with flow management and extreme events	WATER RESEARCH												This study analyses over a decade (2009-2022) of monitoring data to understand the impact of hydrological characteristics on water quality and phytoplankton dynamics in Prospect Reservoir, a critical water supply for Greater Sydney, Australia, known for its excellent water quality. Water quality and phytoplankton dynamics were related to hydrodynamics, linked to flow management and the water quality of inflows. Phytoplankton biovolume increased after a prolonged drawdown and subsequent refill event, mainly driven by dinoflagellates, and corresponded to increases in total phosphorus and water temperature. The hydrological period following the 2019/2020 summer bushfires (post-bushfire) that impacted connected reservoirs, was marked by increased flow activity and nutrient loading, leading to significant shifts in the phytoplankton community. Functional group classification and ordination analysis indicated a transition from taxa typically dominant in oligotrophic conditions to meso-eutrophic. This transition correlated with elevated nutrient levels and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), and reduced Secchi depth and dissolved oxygen, providing evidence of eutrophication. Q index indicated good water quality post-bushfire, contrasting with a eutrophic status assessment using Chl-a. Our findings highlight the importance of analysing long-term datasets encompassing varied hydroclimatological conditions for a deeper understanding of reservoir behaviour. A comprehensive approach to water quality assessment is recommended, combining functional group classification, Q index and Chl-a measurements for effective reservoir health assessment. This research provides novel insights into the effects of disturbances such as bushfires, on water quality and phytoplankton dynamics in an underrepresented geographic region, offering valuable knowledge for managing water resources amidst growing climate variability.

Thus, there is urgent need to conduct research on the distribution rules and factors influencing phytoplankton in drinking water reservoirs. Given that the outflows from reservoirs usually come from the middle and lower layers of the water column and the current studies on phytoplankton in drinking water reservoirs are usually carried out on the surface, an 8-month monitoring of vertical phytoplankton and the corresponding influencing factors in front of the outlet in a drinking water reservoir was conducted. Based on the monitoring results, the distribution rules of phytoplankton and the associated factors were analyzed. The results showed that phytoplankton biomass significantly decreased with increasing water depth, but the biomass near the outlet (40 m depth) still reached the WHO level 2 warning threshold for algal blooms multiple times. During the monitoring period, Cyanophyta, Chlorophyta and Bacillariophyta dominated. The selected multisource environmental factors explained 60.5 % of the spatiotemporal changes in phytoplankton, with thermal intensity (water temperature and thermal stratification intensity) being the driving factor. Meanwhile, excessive TN and TP provided necessary conditions for the growth of phytoplankton. Based on influencing factors, reducing upstream nutrient inflows and thermal stratification intensity are recommended as measures to prevent and control algal blooms. This study provides insights into the vertical distribution rules and factors influencing phytoplankton in a drinking water reservoir, which can provide a reference for the management of drinking water reservoirs and the prevention and control of algal blooms.					li, zhenghe/JDN-0855-2023														0048-9697	1879-1026				DEC 1	2023	902								166512	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.166512	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.166512		AUG 2023						37619726					WOS:001067721600001
J	WOIWODE, JG; ADELMAN, IR				WOIWODE, JG; ADELMAN, IR			EFFECTS OF TEMPERATURE, PHOTOPERIOD, AND RATION SIZE ON GROWTH OF HYBRID STRIPED BASS X WHITE BASS	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Growth and food conversion efficiency of hybrid bass juveniles (female striped bass Morone saxatilis x male white bass M. chrysops) were measured as a function of diel oscillating and constant temperatures, spring (increasing day length) and autumnal (decreasing day length) photoperiods, and ration sizes ranging from no food to daily satiation. The optimum temperatures for growth and peak conversion efficiency were estimated to be 26.8 and 21.2-degrees-C, respectively, for fish under constant temperatures, 12 h of daylight, and a maximum ration size. Springtime photoperiod significantly increased growth, and autumnal photoperiod significantly reduced growth. There was a significant temperature-photoperiod interaction; maximum growth occurred at 27.9-degrees-C under the springtime photoperiod and at 25.7-degrees-C under the autumnal photoperiod. Diel temperature oscillations with an amplitude of +/- 4, 6, and 8-degrees-C did not influence growth rate or conversion efficiency. Reduced ration sizes led to a lower optimum temperature for growth. Manipulation of temperature and photoperiod may be advantageous where feasible in intensive culture of hybrid bass. In field situations, stocking hybrid bass, a temperate eurytherm, may be successful where stocking striped bass, a temperate mesotherm, has failed because of thermal restrictions.																			0002-8487					MAR	1991	120	2					217	229		10.1577/1548-8659(1991)120<0217:EOTPAR>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1991)120<0217:EOTPAR>2.3.CO;2													WOS:A1991FR51600009

The most outstanding European ancient lake is the oligotrophic and karstic Balkan Lake Ohrid. The lake is inhabited by a number of endemic species, but their evolutionary history is largely unresolved. in the present study, the genetic structure, gene genealogy and demographic history of the representatives of the Ohridian endemic Proasellus species were studied using both biparentally (allozyme loci) and maternally (partial mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I gene) inherited markers. Both data sets gave similar results and supported discrepancies among genetic differentiation, the current morphology-based taxonomy and bathymetric segregation. Horizontal distribution of endemic Proasellus species (Lake Ohrid vs adjacent feeder springs) within the lake presumably promote parapatric speciation whereas the main role of vertical barriers into diversification processes was not fully supported. The analyses of demographic history suggested the decline of endemic isopod populations. The radiation of endemic Proasellus populations within the lake could have started from the sublittoral/profundal zone towards the littoral or in the opposite direction - from the littoral to the profundal. Our analyses did not exclude both possibilities.

A new rail stop - Tracking moderate physical activity bouts and ridership	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PREVENTIVE MEDICINE												Background: The natural intervention of a new light-rail stop in a neighborhood is examined for relationships with ridership and moderate-activity bouts. Design: At Time 1, surveys and 1-week accelerometer readings assess transit use and moderate-activity bouts. One year later (Time 2), after the opening of a new light-rail stop, measures were repeated. Setting/Participants: During the summers of 2005 and 2006, 51 residents participated from a low-income, mixed ethnicity neighborhood in Salt Lake City, Utah. Intervention: A new light-rail stop was built and opened in the middle of the surveyed neighborhood. Main Outcome Measures: Physical activity was measured as a bout of 8 or more minutes of moderate activity (3.0 metabolic units [METS]), according to accelerometer counts, controlling for hours worn. Prompted recalls allowed moderate-activity bouts to be labeled as walks to transit or not. Results: Analyses in 2006-2007 show that the percentage of rail riders increased significantly, from 50% to 68.75%, after the stop opened. In cross-sectional analyses at Times 1 and 2, self-reported rides on light rail were significantly related to more moderate-activity bouts, controlling for gender, household size, and home ownership. Longitudinally, with the same control variables and adding Time I moderate activity, light-rail rides at Time 2 predicted increased Time 2 moderate activity. Conclusions: A new rail stop was associated with increased ridership. Walks to light rail were associated, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally, with moderate-activity bouts.																			0749-3797	1873-2607				OCT	2007	33	4					306	309		10.1016/j.amepre.2007.06.002	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.amepre.2007.06.002								17888857					WOS:000249965400006
J	Kullman, L				Kullman, L			Early holocene tree growth at a high elevation site in the northernmost Scandes of Sweden (Lapland): A palaeobiogeographical case study based on megafossil evidence	GEOGRAFISKA ANNALER SERIES A-PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY												The paper focuses on early Holocene tree growth and alpine tree-limits in the northernmost Swedish Scandes (Lapland). Megafossil wood remnants in peats and lakes were searched for over a large area at elevations high above the modem tree-limits. Wood of Pinus sylvestris, Betula pubescens ssp. tortuosa and Alnus incana was discovered near the shore of a small lake (999 m a.s.l.) c. 500 m higher than today's tree-limit of Pinus sylvestris in this region. Radiocarbon dating yielded values of unprecedented age, c. 8500-8100 C-14 years sp for all three species and in addition 5400-4500 C-14 years sp for Betula and Alnus. The highest position of the Pinus tree-limit occurred during the early Holocene, which compares well with the situation reconstructed by megafossils in the southern Scandes. It now appears that the long-term tree-limit and climate histories are broadly the same in entire mid- and northern Fennoscandia. Corrected for glacio-isostatic land uplift, the tree-limit record suggests that the summers were c. 2.4 degrees C warmer than today at 8500 C-14 years sp. A dry continental climate with substantial seasonal contrasts is likely to have prevailed during this period, which restricted the occurrence of glaciers and glacier activity. Most circumstances point to the overriding importance of the Milankovitch orbital theory for pacing or forcing the long-term postglacial climate change. The results are inconsistent with most inferences based on pollen, certain macrofossil records and general circulation simulations. These proxy environmental histories have frequently advocated a mid-Holocene thermal optimum and an oceanic and humid climate in northern and western Fennoscandia during the early Holocene. The uncovered discrepancy between the outcome of the objective and factual megafossil method and more subjective/inferential microfossil methods should be important for Quaternary plant ecology in general, stressing the usefulness of megafossil studies.																			0435-3676	1468-0459					1999	81A	1					63	74		10.1111/j.0435-3676.1999.00049.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0435-3676.1999.00049.x													WOS:000081593400005

The regional aquifer consists of fractured and karstified limestone - aquifers of Cretaceous age, and it can be separated into a Cenomanian aquifer (upper aquifer) and Albian aquifer (lower aquifer). Both aquifers are exposed along the mountain ridge around Jerusalem, which is the main recharge area. From here, the recharged ground water flows in a highly karstified aquifer system towards the east and discharges in springs in the lower Jordan Valley and Dead Sea region. We investigated the Eastern Mountain Aquifer system for groundwater flow, groundwater age and potential mixtures, and groundwater recharge. We combined Cl-36 / Cl, tritium, and the anthropogenic gases SF6, CFC-12 (chlorofluorocarbon) and CFC-11, while using CFC-113 as "dating" tracers to estimate the young water components inside the Eastern Mountain Aquifer system. By application of lumped parameter models, we verified young groundwater components from the last 10 to 30 years and an admixture of a groundwater component older than about 70 years. Concentrations of nitrate, simazine (pesticide), acesulfame K (ACE-K; artificial sweetener) and naproxen (NAP; drug) in the groundwater were further indications of infiltration during the last 30 years. The combination of multiple environmental tracers and lumped parameter modelling helped to understand the groundwater age distribution and to estimate recharge despite scarce data in this very complex hydrogeological setting. Our groundwater recharge rates support groundwater management of this politically difficult area and can be used to inform and calibrate ongoing groundwater flow models.					; Mallast, Ulf/I-6335-2019; Wilske, Cornelia/AAS-9100-2021; Suckow, Axel/E-3295-2012; Merkel, Broder/O-3237-2019; Siebert, Christian/D-3380-2013	Merchel, Silke/0000-0002-8755-3980; Pavetich, Stefan/0000-0001-8014-0545; Merkel, Broder/0000-0002-6995-1176; Meier, Christiane/0000-0003-3126-5186; Mallast, Ulf/0000-0001-9238-3464; 													1027-5606	1607-7938				JAN 16	2020	24	1					249	267		10.5194/hess-24-249-2020	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-249-2020													WOS:000508135000004

The maximum Cs-137 concentrations measured in each lake's sediment ranged from 74.0 +/- 6.09 to 255 +/- 7.48 Bq kg(-1). Factors such as elevation, latitude, and pH showed no correlation to total Cs-137 deposition. However, the data developed during this investigation suggested that characteristics such as geological location or lake flushing patterns are important factors in the total Cs-137 deposition observed. Three of the lakes had Cs-137 sediment depth distributions that resembled the deposition pattern of weapons testing as a function of time. Mean sedimentation rate estimates ranged from 0.08 +/- 0.3 to 0.1 +/- 0.05 cm y(-1) and decreased with increasing altitude.																			0017-9078	1538-5159				OCT	2018	115	4					458	464		10.1097/HP.0000000000000908	http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/HP.0000000000000908								30148811					WOS:000443953400006

Compositional diversity in insoluble organic matter in type 1, 2 and 3 chondrites as detected by infrared spectroscopy	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												Insoluble organic matter (IOM) isolated from 22 carbonaceous and ordinary chondrites spanning a wide range of groups and petrologic types were analyzed using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Based on common IR spectral features, it is observed that IOM falls into 4 molecularly distinct groups (designated here as A through D). Spectral group A includes type 1 and 2 chondrites and exhibits intense aliphatic C-H and carboxyl vibrational peaks. Spectral group B includes the least metamorphosed type 3 chondrites and Tagish Lake, and exhibits weaker aliphatic and carboxyl vibrational intensity. Spectral groups C and D include metamorphosed type >= 3.1 chondrites and a heated CM chondrite. The carbonyl stretching features in spectral groups C and D differ from that in spectral groups A and B and from each other. In spectral group C, the carbonyl stretching is assigned to cyclic unsaturated lactones; in spectral group D carbonyl exists predominantly in the form of unsaturated ketone moieties. Both spectral groups C and D have a relatively narrow band structure around 1210 cm(-1) (assigned to aromatic skeletal modes) as compared with spectral groups A and B, which is consistent with the formation of more condensed aromatics by extensive thermal metamorphism. The differences in carbonyl structures in spectral groups C and D are not the result of different effective metamorphic temperatures, rather these differences likely result from variation in the activity of water and oxygen at different stages of parent body metamorphism. Such environmental variations must be local phenomena in the parent bodies as there is no correlation between spectral grouping and chondrite class or group. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Since the mid-twentieth century, rising temperatures have led to unsustainably high melting rates for many glaciers, particularly in the Himalaya, temporarily increasing summer meltwater run-off but continuously reducing the ice-storage volume. In this Review, we discuss how and why glaciers and meltwater supplies have changed, how they will likely evolve in the future and how these changes impact water resources and water-related hazards. Heterogeneous glacier retreat is changing streamflow patterns, in turn, affecting the incidence of glacial-lake outburst floods and exacerbating the risk of flooding and water shortages associated with future climate change. These changes could negatively impact downstream populations and infrastructure, including the thriving hydropower sector and some of the world's largest irrigated agriculture systems, by making water flow more extreme and unpredictable. An improved in situ monitoring network for weather, hydrology and glacier change is a crucial requirement for predicting the future of this resource and associated hazards, and their impact on regional water, energy and food security. Glaciers in the Himalaya and Karakoram mountain ranges provide freshwater and hydropower to millions of people but are also melting at unsustainably high rates. This Review discusses recent and projected changes in glacier melt and resulting implications for regional water-related hazards and water resources. Key pointsHimalayan glaciers have lost mass at an accelerating rate in recent decades, in contrast with relatively stable Karakoram glaciers.Under a range of climate change scenarios, the run-off of glacier meltwater in the Himalaya and Karakoram is likely to peak in the next few decades.After glacial run-off peaks, run-off will decline as the glaciers in both mountain ranges shrink, although the magnitude and timing of the peak and the rate of subsequent decline are uncertain.Basin run-off regimes will become more rain-dominated as the modulating effect of glaciers decreases, and this is likely to increase the impact of droughts and floods.The frequency of glacial-lake outburst floods and run-off floods have increased recently and could increase further in coming decades, threatening existing and planned hydropower infrastructure downstream.A lower-emissions climate change pathway would reduce the rate of glacier loss, increasing the time available for adaptation. This pathway would have considerable socio-economic benefits.					; Liu, Shiyin/AAT-4278-2020; Nepal, Santosh/GSO-2458-2022; Pritchard, Hamish/AAU-4696-2021; Sun, Meng/M-7203-2019; Wang, Xiaoming/A-3804-2008	LIU, Shiyin/0000-0002-9625-7497; nie, yong/0000-0002-6075-8564; Wang, Xiaoming/0000-0002-6648-0057														2662-138X				FEB	2021	2	2					91	106		10.1038/s43017-020-00124-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s43017-020-00124-w													WOS:000671874300005

Risk factors for sporadic Giardia infection in the USA: a case-control study in Colorado and Minnesota	EPIDEMIOLOGY & INFECTION												Giardia duodenalis is the most common intestinal parasite of humans in the USA, but the risk factors for sporadic (non-outbreak) giardiasis are not well described. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Colorado and Minnesota public health departments conducted a case-control study to assess risk factors for sporadic giardiasis in the USA. Cases (N = 199) were patients with non-outbreak-associated laboratory-confirmed Giardia infection in Colorado and Minnesota, and controls (N = 381) were matched by age and site. Identified risk factors included international travel (aOR = 13.9; 95% CI 4.9-39.8), drinking water from a river, lake, stream, or spring (aOR = 6.5; 95% CI 2.0-20.6), swimming in a natural body of water (aOR = 3.3; 95% CI 1.5-7.0), male-male sexual behaviour (aOR = 45.7; 95% CI 5.8-362.0), having contact with children in diapers (aOR = 1.6; 95% CI 1.01-2.6), taking antibiotics (aOR = 2.5; 95% CI 1.2-5.0) and having a chronic gastrointestinal condition (aOR = 1.8; 95% CI 1.1-3.0). Eating raw produce was inversely associated with infection (aOR = 0.2; 95% CI 0.1-0.7). Our results highlight the diversity of risk factors for sporadic giardiasis and the importance of non-international-travel-associated risk factors, particularly those involving person-to-person transmission. Prevention measures should focus on reducing risks associated with diaper handling, sexual contact, swimming in untreated water, and drinking untreated water.

J	Ortiz, DI; Wozniak, A; Tolson, MW; Turner, PE				Ortiz, DI; Wozniak, A; Tolson, MW; Turner, PE			Arbovirus circulation, temporal distribution, and abundance of mosquito species in two Carolina bay habitats	VECTOR-BORNE AND ZOONOTIC DISEASES												Carolina bays, a type of geomorphic feature, may be important in the ecology of mosquito vectors in South Carolina. Their hydrology varies from wetland habitats with marked flooding/drying regimes to permanently flooded spring-fed lakes. Moreover, they possess characteristics that contribute to the support of a particularly abundant and diverse invertebrate fauna. Although it has been estimated that 2,700+ bays exist in South Carolina, approximately 97% have been altered; <= 200 bays remain intact, and only 36 are protected by state-funded conservation projects. We conducted a study in two distinct Carolina bay habitats, Savage Bay Heritage Preserve (SBHP) and Woods Bay State Park (WBSP), from June 1997 to July 1998 to determine mosquito temporal distribution, species composition, and the occurrence of arbovirus activity. The largest mosquito collection was obtained at WBSP (n = 31,172) representing 25 species followed by SBHP (n = 3,940) with 24 species. Anopheles crucians complex were the most common species encountered in both bays. Two virus isolates were obtained from SBHP in 1997: Keystone (KEY) virus from Ochlerotatus atlanticus-tormentor and Cache Valley (CV) virus from Oc. canadensis canadensis. Twenty-nine (29) arbovirus-positive pools were obtained from WBSP: 28 in 1997 and one in 1998. KEY virus was isolated from three pools of Oc. atlanticus-tormentor and Tensaw (TEN) virus was isolated from two pools of An. crucians complex; 10 isolates could not be identified with the sera available. Additionally, 14 pools of An. crucians complex tested positive for Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) virus antigen. These represent the first record of KEY and CV viruses in South Carolina. Our data indicate the presence of high mosquito density and diversity in both Carolina bay habitats, which may be influenced, in part, by seasonal changes in their hydroperiods. The study of mosquito and arbovirus ecology in Carolina Bay habitats could provide more information on the transmission dynamics of arboviruses and its impact on human and animal arboviral disease occurrence in South Carolina.

Variability in the drivers of microplastic consumption by fish across four lake ecosystems	FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE												Microplastic (<5 mm) pollution has been documented globally throughout freshwater and marine ecosystems. Exposure to and ingestion of microplastics presents a threat to the health of aquatic and marine organisms and humans through the consumption of fish and crustaceans. Understanding the factors which influence microplastic ingestion by fish is a key step in predicting the potential health risks. Drivers of microplastic consumption have been studied in lab settings, but there has been limited ability to confirm in field studies. Here we examine the roles and contributions of feeding guild, pelagic microplastic concentrations, and fish length to microplastic consumption by three species of fish across four lake ecosystems in Minnesota, United States. Fish samples were collected in the summers of 2019 and 2020 and processed to determine variability in microplastic ingestion. Identifying particles between 0.18 and 5 mm, plastic ingestion ranged from 0.6 microplastics fish(-1) in Elk Lake (low surface water microplastics) bluegill to 1.09 microplastics fish(-1) in White Iron Lake (moderate surface water microplastics) cisco. Results indicate that microplastic consumption by filter feeding cisco is driven by surface water microplastic concentrations, while microplastic consumption by visual feeding bluegill and yellow perch is not. Additionally, the high variability of ingestion between lake ecosystems coupled with the complex behavior of some fish species presents difficulties in identifying primary drivers of microplastic consumption that would be broadly applicable across ecosystems and species.

J	Xing, SY; Shi, N; Zhou, BT				Xing, Shaoying; Shi, Ning; Zhou, Botao			Energy budget characteristics of the subseasonal Scandinavian pattern	ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH												Based on daily Japanese 55-year reanalysis data, this study analysed the daily energy budget characteristics of 94 Scandinavian (SCA) events in the positive phase during 62 winters from 1958 to 2020. Low-frequency circulation anomalies characterize the SCA events. The maintenance of low-frequency anomalies mainly comes from the extraction of both available potential energy (APE) and kinetic energy (KE) from the background field during both the developing stage and the decaying stage. This energy conversion characteristic is related to the "locking" effect of the background field. During the developing stage, the interactions among the low-frequency circulation anomalies continuously generate KE, which is the main source for initiating the primary circulation anomalies around western Europe and the Scandinavian Peninsula. Meanwhile, the horizontal KE advection maintains the KE of the circulation anomalies around Lake Baikal. The decay process of the SCA events is mainly related to the damping effect on the APE due to diabatic heating and the interactions among the low-frequency circulation anomalies. The SCA event is a type of atmospheric internal dynamic pattern.

Review and Meta-Analysis of the Environmental Biology and Potential Invasiveness of a Poorly-Studied Cyprinid, the Ide Leuciscus idus	REVIEWS IN FISHERIES SCIENCE & AQUACULTURE												The ide Leuciscus idus is a large-bodied cyprinid native to freshwaters around the Baltic, Black, Caspian, White, Barents, Kara, Laptev and North seas as well as the Aral Sea region. Historically an important commercial species, the ide is used in recreational fisheries and as an ornamental fish, and is subject to translocation and stocking events. The ide is less well-studied than many European cyprinids and relatively little is known of the risks it poses to native species and ecosystems where introduced. The present review and meta-analysis examine available data on the ide's environmental biology to provide an assessment of its potential invasiveness. A long-lived, omnivorous species, the ide is a habitat generalist that inhabits lowland rivers and nutrient-rich lakes, but also some brackish waters where it is facultatively anadromous. The ide displays variable age and length at maturity and asymptotic growth in body length, can be highly productive and migratory, and can withstand variable environmental conditions. Despite several attributes that should facilitate acclimation to novel environments, the ide has established relatively few self-sustaining populations outside its native range, and is therefore not currently considered to be invasive. However, as introductions are likely to continue, increased propagule pressure could lead to the development of invasive non-native populations in some locations.

Under-ice noise generated from diamond exploration in a Canadian sub-arctic lake and potential impacts on fishes	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA												Mineral exploration is increasing in Canada, particularly in the north where extensive diamond mining and exploration are occurring. This study measured the under-ice noise produced by a variety of anthropogenic sources (drilling rigs, helicopters, aircraft landing and takeoff, ice-road traffic, augers, snowmobiles, and chisels) at a winter-based diamond exploration project on Kennady Lake in the Northwest Territories, Canada to infer the potential impact of noise on fishes in the lake. The root-mean-square noise level measured 5 m from a small diameter drill was approximately 46 dB greater (22 kHz bandwidth) than ambient noise, while the acoustic particle velocity was approximately 40 dB higher than ambient levels. The loudest sounds at the exploration site were produced by ice cracking, both natural and during landing and takeoff of a C130 Hercules aircraft. However, even walking on the snow above the ice raised ambient sound levels by approximately 30 dB. Most of the anthropogenic sounds are likely detectable by fishes with hearing specializations, such as chubs and suckers. Other species without specialized hearing adaptations will detect these sounds only close to the source. The greatest potential impact of noise from diamond exploration is likely to be the masking of sounds for fishes with sensitive hearing.

The ecological consequence of precipitation is important, but the underlying processes are not clear. Here we conducted an immediate prior- and after-event short-interval investigation in the Three Gorges Reservoir region, to test whether the short-term changes in the phytoplankton communities and functional groups could be predicted based on the precipitation level. We found that precipitation of moderate and high levels immediately changed the phytoplankton distribution and altered functional groups. According to structural equation model, the vertical velocity (lambda = -0.81), light availability (Zeu/Zmix, lambda = 0.47) and relative water column stability (RWCS, lambda = 0.38) were important parameters for phytoplankton distribution during the precipitation event. Water quality did not directly affect phytoplankton distribution (lambda = -0.11) and effects of precipitation on the water quality only lasted 1-2 days. The phytoplankton community was redistributed with some tolerance functional groups appearance, such as groups F, Lo, M and groups M, MP, TB, W1 appeared duringand after- precipitation event, respectively. We also found that mixing rather than flushing was the driving force for the decrease of phytoplankton biomass. Our study provided valuable data for reservoir regulation and evidence for predictions of phytoplankton during the precipitation events under different climate change scenarios.																			2223-7747					SEP	2021	10	9							1800	10.3390/plants10091800	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants10091800								34579333					WOS:000701075000001

The analytes were quantified by reversed-phase liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. The TBBPA levels in water ranged from below the limit of detection (LOD) to 1.12ng/L, whereas levels in sediments were between 0.056ng/g dry weight and 2.15ng/g dry weight. Regarding HBCD, concentrations were from below the LOD to 0.37ng/L for water samples and from 0.046ng/g dry weight to 2.56ng/g dry weight for sediments. No correlation was found between sediment total organic carbon content and TBBPA/HBCDs, while significant positive correlations (r(2)=0.63, p<0.005) were observed between TBBPA concentrations and HBCD concentrations in sediments. The highest TBBPA (2.15ng/g dry wt) and total HBCD concentration (2.56ng/g dry wt) was found at sampling site 1 (S1), while total HBCD levels fell dramatically with increasing distance from S1, suggesting that the estuary inputs around Taihu Lake were important sources of TBBPA and HBCDs. Compared with the pollution levels in the other regions of the world, the concentrations of TBBPA and HBCDs in Taihu Lake were at a moderate or low level. Further study on the sources of TBBPA and HBCDs is required for both assessment of their potential risks and better pollution management in Taihu Lake. Environ Toxicol Chem 2013;32:2249-2255.

Variations in late Quaternary wind intensity from grain-size partitioning of loess deposits in the Nenana River Valley, Alaska	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												A high-resolution column of 57 loess samples was collected from the Dry Creek archaeological site in the Nenana River Valley in central Alaska. Numerical grain-size partitioning using a mixed Weibull function was performed on grain-size distributions to obtain a reconstructed record of wind intensity over the last similar to 15,000 yr. Two grain-size components were identified, one with a mode in the coarse silt range (C1) and the other ranging from medium to very coarse sand (C2). C1 dominates most samples and records regional northerly winds carrying sediment from the Nenana River. These winds were strong during cold intervals, namely, the Carlo Creek glacial readvance (14.2-14 ka), a late Holocene Neoglacial period (4.2-2.7 ka), and recent glacier expansion; weak during the Allerod (14-13.3 ka) and Younger Dryas (12.9-11.7 ka); and variable during the Holocene thermal maximum (11.4-9.4 ka). Deposition of C2 was episodic and represents locally derived sand deposited by southerly katabatic winds from the Alaska Range. These katabatic winds occurred mainly prior to 12 ka and after 4 ka. This study shows that numerical grain-size partitioning is a powerful tool for reconstructing paleoclimate and that it can be successfully applied to Alaskan loess.

J	Bickford, ME; Wooden, JL; Bauer, RL				Bickford, ME; Wooden, JL; Bauer, RL			SHRIMP study of zircons from Early Archean rocks in the Minnesota River Valley: Implications for the tectonic history of the superior province	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN												Interest in Palleoarchean to early Mesoarchean crust in North America has been sparked by the recent identification of ca. 3800-3500 Ma rocks on the northern margin of the Superior craton in the Assean Lake region of northern Manitoba and the Porpoise Cove terrane in northern Quebec. It has long been known that similarly ancient gneisses are exposed on the southern margin of the Superior craton in the Minnesota River Valley and in northern Michigan, but the ages of these rocks have been poorly constrained, because methods applied in the 1960s through late 1970s were inadequate to unravel the complexities of their thermotectonic history. Rocks exposed in the Minnesota River Valley include a complex of migmatitic granitic gneisses, schistose to gneissic amphibolite, metagabbro, and paragneisses. The best-known units are the Morton Gneiss and the Montevideo Gneiss. The complex of ancient gneisses is intruded by a major younger, weakly deformed granite body, the Sacred Heart granite. Regional geophysical anomalies that extend across the Minnesota River Valley have been interpreted as defining boundaries between distinct blocks containing the various gneissic units. New sensitive high-resolution ion microprobe (SHRIMP) U-Pb data from complex zircons yielded the following ages: Montevideo Gneiss near Montevideo, 3485 +/- 10 Ma, granodiorite intrusion, 3385 +/- 8 Ma; Montevideo Gneiss at Granite Falls, 3497 +/- 9 Ma, metamorphic event, 3300-3350 Ma, matic intrusion, 3141 +/- 2 Ala, metamorphic overprint (rims), 2606 +/- 4 Ma; Morton Gneiss: 3524 +/- 9 Ma, granodiorite intrusion, 3370 +/- 8 Ma, metamorphic overprints (growth of rims), 3140 +/- 2 Ma and 2595 +/- 4 Ma; biotitegarnet paragneiss, 2619 +/- 20 Ma; and Sacred Heart granite, 2604 +/- 4 Ma. Zircons from a cordierite-bearing feldspar-biotite schist overlying the Morton Gneiss yielded well-defined age peaks at 3520, 3480, 3380, and 3140 Ma, showing detrital input from most of the older rock units; 2600 Ma rims on these zircons indicate metamorphism at this time. Zircons from a hypersthene-bearing biotite-garnet paragneiss, overlying the Montevideo Gneiss near Granite Falls, yielded ca. 2600 Ma ages, indicating zircon growth during high-grade metamorphism at this time. Despite some differences in the intensity of the 2600 Ma event between the Morton and Montevideo blocks, both blocks display similar thermochronologic relationships and ages, suggesting that their boundary is not a fundamental suture between two distinct Paleoarchean terranes. Previously obtained zircon age data from the tonalitic gneiss at Watersmeet Dome in northern Michigan indicated formation at ca. 3500 Ma, whereas a granite body near Thayer was dated at 2745 +/- 65 Ma and leucogranite dikes are ca. 2600 Ma. Thus, these rocks and those in the Minnesota River Valley were formed in the late Paleoarchean and show a history of igneous activity and metamorphism in the Mesoarchean and Neoarchean. The occurrence of ancient crustal rocks on both the northern and southern margins of the ca. 2900-2700 Superior craton suggests that they are remnants of once more-extensive Paleoarchean crust that existed prior to formation of the Neoarchean Superior craton.																			0016-7606	1943-2674				JAN-FEB	2006	118	1-2					94	108		10.1130/B25741.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/B25741.1													WOS:000234587600006

Haul-out site use by Ladoga ringed seal (Pusa hispida ladogensis) on the islands of the Valaam Archipelago	LIMNOLOGY												In June-July 2020, a study of the Ladoga ringed seal haul-out use pattern was carried out on the islands of the Valaam Archipelago, Lake Ladoga, in North-Western Russia, where the subspecies' largest summer haul-outs are observed annually. Trail cameras automatically collected imagery every 10 min, 24 h a day. Over 22,000 images were collected with 198 camera-days, and seals were present in over 20% of them. The total number of seals photographed by all cameras per day ranged from 2 to 149 individuals. The seals typically began approaching the haul-out sites at night, with abundance peaking between 8:00 a.m. and 12:00 p.m. local time, and then gradually declining during the afternoon hours. Changes in air temperature, wind direction, wind speed, and wave height affected the likelihood of seals remaining at the haul-outs. Major disturbances, such as motorboats or helicopters, drove the seals to leave their resting areas, and during the morning and evening hours resulted in at least 6-h disruption of haul-out dynamics. This research presents a reliable, cost-effective approach for monitoring Ladoga ringed seal at coastal haul-outs which has direct implications to addressing population conservation needs.

Tracking neonicotinoids following their use as cotton seed treatments	PEERJ												Neonicotinoids are a leading class of insecticides on the global market, accounting for nearly 25%. They are widely used in both agricultural and residential settings. Causing neuron failure by irreversibly binding to the insect nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, neonicotinoids offer broad spectrum efficacy against a variety of pests. However, because they are non-selective with regard to insect species, there has been some concern with neonicotinoid use over threats to pollinators such as honeybees, and potential indirect effects to migratory waterfowl as a result of invertebrate prey population depletion. In order to study occurrence and fate of neonicotinoids (thiamethoxam and imidacloprid), we analyzed cotton leaves on plants grown from neonicotinoid-treated seeds and corresponding soil samples between cotton rows. Neonicotinoid concentration data from cotton leaves appears to be consistent with the claim that seed treatments protect plants for 3-4 weeks; by 30 days post-planting, neonicotinoid concentrations fell, in general, to 200 ng/g or lower. This represents about a 10-fold decrease from plant concentrations at approximately 2 weeks post-planting. It was found that neonicotinoids used as seed treatments remained present in the soil for months post planting and could be available for runoff. To that end, 21 playa wetlands were sampled; 10 had at least one quantifiable neonicotinoid present, three of which were classified as grassland or rangeland playas, two were urban, and the remaining five were cropland playas. In several instances, neonicotinoid concentrations in playas exceeded EPA chronic benchmarks for aquatic invertebrates.

J	Campbell, IC				Campbell, Ian C.			Integrated management of large rivers and their basins	ECOHYDROLOGY & HYDROBIOLOGY												It has become standard practice to refer to any management of rivers and their basins as "integrated''. The development and use of the concept reflects a growing appreciation of the complexity of river basins as hydrological, ecological, economic, political and social systems. However, the term "integrated management'' is used vaguely, and, although the need for a management approach which considers more than a narrow focus on hydrology or economics is widely recognized, there has been concern that the term is often used as camouflage in an attempt of gaining acceptance or funding for a narrowly based project. There has also been discussion about the applicability of river basins as planning units, given that large basins rarely coincide with political units, and the role of, and need for, river basin management organizations. It is clear that the management of water resources and environmental resources generally requires consideration of a broad and increasing range of factors and input from a much wider range of stakeholders than was generally recognized in the past, and a lack of shared objectives as well as both technical and governance challenges inhibit integrated management in many basins. Progress towards integrated management is patchy and it will not be achieved in a single step. Where programs are integrated in name only, that is evidence of incremental progress and even small steps bring benefits.

Investigation of nutrient limitation status and nutrient pathways in Lake Hayes, Otago, New Zealand: a case study for integrated lake assessment	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												We present a case study illustrating an integrated approach to lake water quality assessment, for Lake Hayes. Otago, New Zealand. This approach improved understanding of the biological importance of several macro- an micronutrients and their major pathways (including groundwater). and, coupled with trophic state monitoring, could be the basis for more effective management of lakes exhibiting algal blooms. A nutrient enrichment bioassay experiment found that additions of zinc and nitrogen stimulated productivity, indicating, that phytoplankton growth in the lake may have been limited by these nutrients. Nutrient data confirmed the potential for nitrogen limitation at times. The main source of nutrients to the lake was the surface inflow, but almost 30% of the nitrate input entered the lake via a groundwater-fed spring. highlighting the importance of nutrients in groundwater as a potential driver of algal proliferation. A recent shift in phytoplankton community structure from dominance of cyanobacteria and desmids to dominance of mobile, mixotrophic dinoflagellates indicates that the dominant phytoplankter may no longer be restricted to using, only epilimnetic and inorganic forms of nutrients. This integrated assessment of Lake Hayes also suggested strong internal phosphorus cycling. which Could explain why phytoplankton blooms Continue despite improved catchment nutrient management.																			0028-8330					SEP	2008	42	3					285	295		10.1080/00288330809509956	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288330809509956													WOS:000261136700003
J	Abdeldayem, R				Abdeldayem, Raafat			Domestic water and accumulating mercury toxicity in the kidney	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												Chronic kidney disorder may even be a significant health concern in Delta region particularly Dakahlia district, Egypt that's characterized by permanent loss of kidney function through the years. Mercury considered as a silent threat to the environment and human life, through the world. This work purposes to access the effects of mercury overload in domestic water on the renal function. The study performed in spring 2019 on one hundred participants and conducted in two main areas that are getting ready to Lake Manzala. 100 ml of water, 40 ml of urine and 10 ml of blood samples from patients suffering from kidney diseases and healthy individuals as control group. These samples will be processed and analyzed to determine the incidence of active kidney disease. Mean levels of mercury in water, and urine samples of case group participants exceeded standard references and were significantly higher compared to control group (p = 0.0004 and 0.023 respectively) denoting more exposure to mercury. Proteinuria was significantly higher (p = 0.031) whereas, hemoglobin and hematocrit became significantly lower (p = 0.039 and 0.044 respectively) among case group participants which might be an indicator for kidney affection due to mercury exposure. Mercury overload in domestic water can cause renal impairment. The study showed that urinalysis for Proteinuria and hemoglobin values is commonly used as a screening test to detect kidney damage caused by mercury poisoning. Measures to prevent environmental pollutants and continuous monitoring of water sources in these districts are clearly necessary.						abdeldayem, raafat/0000-0001-5052-5954													2190-5487	2190-5495				JUN	2022	12	6							114	10.1007/s13201-021-01551-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13201-021-01551-w													WOS:000782790900002

The fisheries management in the lakes was based first of all on intensive stocking with vendace larvae and intensive catching of predatory fish. The catches were predominated by roach (Rutilus rutilus) (32%) and vendace (30%). Vendace catches were positively related to stocking rates, and negatively related to the proportion of roach in catches. There was also a negative relation between the proportion of vendace in catches and predatory fish catches. It is suggested that: 1) Stocking was the main management practice which allowed the maintenance of vendace population at a relatively high level. 2) The negative relation between roach and vendace catches can be explained by two possibilities: food competition between roach and vendace or roach predation on vendace larvae in the spring. 3) Reduction of the predatory fishes in Ostroda lakes may have intensified competition between roach and vendace because roach commonly is dominant in the food of pike (Esox lucius), perch (Perca fluviatilis) and eel (Anguilla anguilla), whereas predatory pressure on vendace seems to be insignificant.

The mean (above- and belowground) biomass of P. pectinatus from July 1993 - April 1994 was at a maximum in September and ranged between 340.9 +/- 38.4 and 480.6 +/- 91.8 g dry mass (DM)/m(2) depending on the area. Tubers represented 10-30 % of this biomass. In R. cirrhosa maximum biomass of 368.7 +/- 68.1 g DM/mn(2) was recorded in October. In both species about 40 % of the total biomass was allocated to the roots and rhizomes. The production estimates in the Ichkeul lagoon are within the same range as estimates for other Mediterranean lagoons. Other energy sources in the Ichkeul lagoon were litter (60.1 g DM/m(2)), the overwintered roots and rhizomes (61.4 g DM/m(2)) and the suspended particulate organic matter (7.64 g DM/m(2)). Total mean energy income from the macrophytes in the Ichkeul ecosystem during the study period is estimated at 5306 kJ/m(2).																			1863-9135						2007	168	3					243	255		10.1127/1863-9135/2007/0168-0243	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/1863-9135/2007/0168-0243													WOS:000245789900005

Nitrification in the water column of Lake Erie: Seasonal patterns, community dynamics, and competition with cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												This study reports directly measured nitrification rates in the water column of western Lake Erie, which is affected by annual cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms, and across all three Lake Erie basins. Over three field seasons, (NH4+)-N-15 stable isotope tracers were employed to quantify nitrification rates, and relative abundances of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria and ammonia-oxidizing archaea were determined via qPCR. Nitrification rates ranged from undetectable to 1,270 nmol L-1 d(-1) and were generally greatest in the western basin near the Maumee River mouth (a major nutrient source). Nitrification rates were highest in early summer, and often lowest during peak cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms months (August and September), before increasing again in October. In the western basin, nitrification was negatively correlated with cyanobacterial biomass. There were no consistent differences in nitrification rates between the three Lake Erie basins. Over the three years in western Lake Erie, ammonia-oxidizing bacteria and ammonia-oxidizing archaea were often present in high and similar abundances, but overall, ammonia-oxidizing bacteria exceeded ammonia-oxidizing archaea, particularly in 2017. No relationships were observed between nitrification rates and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria and ammonia-oxidizing archaea abundances. Thus, despite abundant ammonia-oxidizer DNA, lower nitrification rates during cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms suggest that nitrifiers were poor competitors for regenerated and available NH4+ during these blooms, as also observed in similar systems. Low nitrification rates during cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms could limit system nitrogen removal via denitrification, a natural pathway for its removal and a valuable ecosystem service. Lower denitrification rates allow more bioavailable nitrogen to remain in the system and support biomass and microcystin production; therefore, these results help explain how non-nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms persist, despite low bioavailable nitrogen concentrations during these blooms, and support management efforts to reduce external nitrogen loading to eutrophic systems.

J	Holliday, V; Surovell, T; Johnson, E				Holliday, Vance; Surovell, Todd; Johnson, Eileen			A Blind Test of the Younger Dryas Impact Hypothesis	PLOS ONE												The Younger Dryas Impact Hypothesis (YDIH) states that North America was devastated by some sort of extraterrestrial event similar to 12,800 calendar years before present. Two fundamental questions persist in the debate over the YDIH: Can the results of analyses for purported impact indicators be reproduced? And are the indicators unique to the lower YD boundary (YDB), i.e., similar to 12.8k cal yrs BP? A test reported here presents the results of analyses that address these questions. Two different labs analyzed identical splits of samples collected at, above, and below the similar to 12.8ka zone at the Lubbock Lake archaeological site (LL) in northwest Texas. Both labs reported similar variation in levels of magnetic micrograins (>300 mg/kg >12.8ka and <11.5ka, but <150 mg/kg 12.8ka to 11.5ka). Analysis for magnetic microspheres in one split, reported elsewhere, produced very low to nonexistent levels throughout the section. In the other split, reported here, the levels of magnetic microspherules and nanodiamonds are low or nonexistent at, below, and above the YDB with the notable exception of a sample <11,500 cal years old. In that sample the claimed impact proxies were recovered at abundances two to four orders of magnitude above that from the other samples. Reproducibility of at least some analyses are problematic. In particular, no standard criteria exist for identification of magnetic spheres. Moreover, the purported impact proxies are not unique to the YDB.

J	DABROWSKI, K				DABROWSKI, K			ASCORBIC-ACID STATUS IN HIGH-MOUNTAIN CHARR, SALVELINUS-ALPINUS, IN RELATION TO THE REPRODUCTIVE-CYCLE	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												Concentrations of total and dehydroascorbic acids and of glutathione were determined in tissues of male and female Arctic charr at different stages of the reproductive cycle. In fish inhabiting an Alpine lake (2344 m above sea level) the ascorbic acid concentrations were significantly higher in the ovary (344-mu-g g-1 in August) than in the testis (62.6-mu-g g-1). The ascorbate concentration was significantly higher in liver kidney of males than in females in the period prior to spawning. This suggests that there was an intensive investment of body ascorbate reserves in the ovary and the results indicated that females deposited approximately 10 times the amount of vitamin C in ovaries than males deposited in testes. However, the endogenous stores cannot account for all ascorbate deposited in ovaries and the remainder must come from food consumed in summer. Since the resident charr of the high-mountain lake had the ascorbate concentration in ovary by one order of magnitude higher than in cultured salmonids it is plausible to speculate that the change in ascorbic acid metabolism reflects the adaptation to the harsh environmental conditions.

The effect of CaO2 on the overlying water, interstitial water, sediment, and sediment microorganisms of scenic water was studied. Results for two months indicated that the dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration of the overlying water in the test zone was 3.78 times that in the control zone; the oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) in the overlying water and sediment increased significantly (p = 0.002 and (p) under bar = 0). Meanwhile, CaO2 could effectively inhibit the release of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) from the sediment and could obviously reduce the concentrations of N and P in the overlying water by enhancing the microbiological action. Moreover, the average concentrations of total nitrogen and total phosphorus in the overlying water of the test zone were 46.27% and 50.51% of those in control zone, respectively, and the concentrations of N and P in the interstitial water decreased during the entire experiment. In addition, CaO2 decreased the relative abundance of anaerobic bacteria in the sediment, whereas it increased that of aerobic bacteria and promoted the appearance of the functional bacteria, such as Nitrospirae and Thermodesulfoba. In conclusion, CaO2 can improve the DO and ORP in the eutrophic water effectively and change the microbial community in the sediment to a certain extent, thereby controlling the pollutants released from the sediment and reducing the N and P concentrations in the overlying water. Thus, CaO2 can effectively realize the purification and restoration of the severely eutrophic scenic water. (c) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Quantifying the role of organic phosphorus mineralisation on phytoplankton communities in a warm-monomictic lake	INLAND WATERS												Phosphorus (P) is a key driver of phytoplankton growth in lentic systems. During summer-stratified periods when dissolved inorganic P (DIP) is low, the phytoplankton assemblage often has elevated P uptake rates. Under these conditions, dissolved organic P (DOP) can become an important source of P for phytoplankton and a driver of phytoplankton succession. We examined how DOP mineralisation by alkaline phosphatase (AP) activity (APA), relative to phytoplankton P release (i.e., from exudation and lysis), meets phytoplankton P uptake and how it is associated with phytoplankton community composition changes under thermally stratified DIP-depauperate conditions in a large warm-monomictic lake. We found that when phytoplankton internal P stores were low (<0.65 mu g P mu g(-1) Chl-a), APA increased, resulting in potential DOP mineralisation rates of 88 mu g L-1 h(-1) P, which is at the upper end of rates in the literature. APA represented up to 89% of the total phytoplankton P uptake and was much higher than the rate of phytoplankton P release. We found that elevated APA coincided with peak phytoplankton biovolume and dominance of the phytoplankton assemblage by cyanobacteria. Further, APA was strongly positively associated with the majority of the 10 most dominant cyanobacteria, including the key toxin-producer Raphidiopsis raciborskii (previously Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii). Our results indicate that under DIP-depauperate conditions, DOP mineralised by APA may be a major source of P for phytoplankton, and the ability to produce AP may be a key factor in the occurrence of bloom-forming cyanobacteria.

Conducting large scale mapping of environmental change and separating between naturogenic and anthropogenic drivers is a difficult endeavor in such highly complex systems. In this research a piece-wise linear regression method was used for breakpoint detection in Rain-Use Efficiency (RUE) time series and a classification of ecosystem response types was produced. Supported by earth observation data, field data, and expert knowledge, this study provides empirical evidence regarding the occurrence of drastic changes in RUE (assessment of the timing, the direction and the significance of these changes) in Northern Eurasian ecosystems between 1982 and 2011. About 36% of the study area (3.4 million km(2)) showed significant (P<0.05) trends and/or turning points in RUE during the observation period. A large proportion of detected turning points in RUE occurred around the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 and in the following years which were attributed to widespread agricultural land abandonment. Our study also showed that recurrent droughts deeply affected vegetation productivity throughout the observation period, with a general worsening of the drought conditions in recent years. Moreover, recent human-induced turning points in ecosystem functioning were detected and attributed to ongoing recultivation and change in irrigation practices in the Volgograd region, and to increased salinization and increased grazing intensity around Lake Balkhash. The ecosystem-state assessment method introduced here proved to be a valuable support that highlighted hotspots of potentially altered ecosystems and allowed for disentangling human from climatic disturbances.					de Beurs, Kirsten/GQH-8453-2022; Verbesselt, Jan/B-9044-2012; Verbesselt, Jan/B-8029-2015; Tagesson, Torbern/AGG-5627-2022; Fensholt, Rasmus/L-7951-2014; Prishchepov, Alexander/H-6708-2012; Horion, Stephanie/AAE-3226-2022; Tagesson, Torbern/E-5429-2015	Verbesselt, Jan/0000-0001-7923-4309; de Beurs, Kirsten/0000-0002-9244-3292; Fensholt, Rasmus/0000-0003-3067-4527; Prishchepov, Alexander/0000-0003-2375-1651; Horion, Stephanie/0000-0001-6716-1333; Tagesson, Torbern/0000-0003-3011-1775													1354-1013	1365-2486				AUG	2016	22	8					2801	2817		10.1111/gcb.13267	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.13267								26929395					WOS:000380016800014

Although located in a forested catchment, the lake has undergone major changes in recent decades, including a period of massive heating of surface water when receiving cooling water from a nearby nuclear power plant (1966-1990), accompanied by a greatly shortened water residence time from more than 40 years to less than 300 days. These changes are superimposed by a long-term trend of surface water warming and a concomitant decrease in winter ice cover. Total phosphorus concentrations have quadrupled since 2010 and zones of deep-water oxygen depletion have greatly expanded. The presented dataset covers basic water-chemical and physical records taken at monthly to fortnightly intervals from 1970 to 2020, documenting limnological changes during that period. Furthermore, it serves as a valuable basis to assess and project potential consequences of climate change and other types of environmental change on deep clearwater lakes in temperate climates.					; Grossart, Hans-Peter/E-6705-2017; Nejstgaard, Jens/LSK-4151-2024; Ganzert, Lars/AAT-1992-2021; Wollrab, Sabine/H-2905-2017	Berger, Stella A./0000-0002-8835-545X; Wollrab, Sabine/0000-0003-2430-4845; 														2052-4463				JUN 18	2025	12	1							1028	10.1038/s41597-025-05319-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41597-025-05319-8								40533475					WOS:001512507500001

Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore (INDU) is a park unit along the southern boundary of Lake Michigan in Indiana, USA. An inventory of 19 sites, consisting of a seep, 12 streams, four marshes, a bog, and a fen were examined for mayflies (Ephemeroptera), stoneflies (Plecoptera), and caddisflies (Trichoptera) (EPT taxa). Volunteers and authors collect 35 ultraviolet light traps during summer 2013 and supplementary benthic and adult sampling added species not attracted by lights or that were only present in colder months. Seventy- eight EPT species were recovered: 12 mayflies, two stoneflies, and 64 caddisflies. The EPT richness found at INDU was a low proportion of the number of species known from Indiana: caddisflies contributed only 32.7% of known state fauna, mayflies and stoneflies contributed 8.4% and 2.3%, respectively. Site EPT richness ranged from one for a seep to 34 for an 8 m-wide stream. Richness in streams generally increased with stream size. Seven new state records and rare species are reported. The number of EPT species at INDU is slightly larger than that found at Isle Royale National Park in 2013, and the community composition and evenness between orders were different.						DeWalt, R.

The purpose of the measurements was to document the general nature of the snowpack across this region for the evaluation of satellite-and model-derived estimates of snow water equivalent (SWE). Although detailed, local snow measurements have been made as part of ongoing studies at tundra field sites (e. g., Daring Lake and Trail Valley Creek in the Northwest Territories; Toolik Lake and the Kuparak River basin in Alaska), systematic measurements at the regional scale have not been previously collected across this region of northern Canada. The snow cover consisted of depth hoar and wind slab with small and ephemeral fractions of new, recent, and icy snow. The snow was shallow (<40 cm deep), usually with fewer than six layers. Where snow was deposited on lake and river ice, it was shallower, denser, and more metamorphosed than where it was deposited on tundra. Although highly variable locally, no longitudinal gradients in snow distribution, magnitude, or structure were detected. This regional homogeneity allowed us to identify that the observed spatial variability in passive microwave brightness temperatures was related to subgrid fractional lake cover. Correlation analysis between lake fraction and Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) brightness temperature showed frequency dependent, seasonally evolving relationships consistent with lake ice drivers. Simulations of lake ice thickness and snow depth on lake ice produced from the Canadian Lake Ice Model (CLIMo) indicated that at low frequencies (6.9, 10.7 GHz), correlations with lake fraction were consistent through the winter season, whereas at higher frequencies (18.7, 36.5 GHz), the strength and direction of the correlations evolved consistently with the penetration depth as the influence of the subice water was replaced by emissions from the ice and snowpack. A regional rain-on-snow event created a surface ice lens that was detectable using the AMSR-E 36.5-GHz polarization gradient due to a strong response at the horizontal polarization. The appropriate polarization for remote sensing of the tundra snowpack depends on the application: horizontal measurements are suitable for ice lens detection; vertically polarized measurements are appropriate for deriving SWE estimates.

Based on a comparative analysis of modern flood sediments and multidisciplinary approaches such as AMS(14)C and archaeological dating, zircon micromorphology, grain size, magnetic susceptibility, and geochemistry, we identified palaeoflood sediments preserved at the Zhongqiao archaeological site. The results indicate that three palaeoflood events (i.e. 4800-4597, 4479-4367, and 4168-3850 cal. yr BP) occurred at the Zhongqiao Site. Comparisons of palaeoflood deposit layers at a number of Neolithic cultural sites show that two extraordinary palaeoflood events occurred in the Jianghan Plain during approximately 4900-4600 cal. yr BP (i.e.mid-late Qujialing cultural period) and 4100-3800 cal. yr BP (i.e. from late Shijiahe cultural period to the Xia Dynasty). Further analysis of the environmental context suggests that these flooding events might have been connected with great climate variability during approximately 5000-4500 cal. yr BP and at ca. 4000 cal. yr BP. These two palaeoflood events were closely related to the expansion of the Jianghan lakes driven by the climatic change, which in turn influenced the rise and fall of the Neolithic cultures in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River. Other evidence also suggests that the intensified discrepancy between social development and environmental change processes (especially the hydrological process) during the late Shijiahe cultural period might be the key factor causing the collapse of the Shijiahe Culture. The extraordinary floods related to the climatic anomaly at ca. 4000 cal. yr BP and political conflicts from internal or other cultural areas all accelerated the collapse of the Shijiahe Culture.

It has recently been shown that sunlight absorption by CDOM can be conveniently approximated based on its monochromatic absorption at 560 nm. Here we show that such an approximation allows for the assessment of CDOM photoreactions on a wide global scale and, particularly, in the latitude belt between 60 degrees S and 60 degrees N. Global lake databases are currently incomplete as far as water chemistry is concerned, but estimates of the content of organic matter are available. With such data it is possible to assess global steady-state concentrations of CDOM triplet states (3CDOM*), which are predicted to reach particularly high values at Nordic latitudes during summer, due to a combination of high sunlight irradiance and elevated content of organic matter. For the first time to our knowledge, we are able to model an indirect photochemistry process in inland waters around the globe. Implications are discussed for the phototransformation of a contaminant that is mainly degraded by reaction with 3CDOM* (clofibric acid, lipid regulator metabolite), and for the formation of known products on a wide geographic scale.

However, the biogeography of different mangrove species is still unclear, especially near their latitudinal range limits in the two continents. This study utilizes palynological, geochemical, and sedimentological analyses to record changes in the coastal morphology and vegetation during the Holocene in Cedar Keys, Florida, the mangrove sub-range limit in North America. The multi-proxy dataset indicates that the milder winters during the Medieval Climate Anomaly likely facilitated the establishment of mangroves in the study region, where Avicennia, Laguncularia, and Rhizophora were established in the similar to 12th (790-850 cal yr BP), similar to 14th (580-660 cal yr BP), and similar to 16th century (440-460 cal yr BP), respectively. Thus, the Medieval Climate Anomaly likely triggered the poleward mangrove migration in North and South America synchronously. Moreover, the multi-proxy dataset also documents the obliteration of the Woodland Culture near Cedar Keys, where a once-thriving native civilization on Seahorse Key was driven out by the European colonizers, who settled on the mainland and Atsena Otie Key. Over time, the relict sites of the Woodland people on Seahorse Key were covered by mangroves and marsh vegetation since the similar to 16th century. Overall, our dataset suggests that industrial-era warming may have intensified the poleward mangrove expansion, although this trend had started earlier during the Medieval Climate Anomaly.					; rodrigues, érika do socorro ferreira/AFY-6065-2022; Liu, Kam-Biu/B-4966-2012; Cancela Lisboa Cohen, Marcelo/AAQ-8080-2020	Yao, Qiang/0000-0003-4833-7510; Cohen, Marcelo/0000-0001-9892-4719; 													0048-9697	1879-1026				FEB 10	2023	859		1						160189	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.160189	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.160189		NOV 2022						36395834					WOS:000898641100005

Interactions between Short-Wave Troughs and Shore-Parallel Lake-Effect Bands over Lake Ontario	WEATHER AND FORECASTING												Great Lakes region forecasting experience indicates that some of the most intense winter precipitation events occur when an upper-level short-wave trough approaches ongoing lake-effect convection. A 10 cold-season climatology of short-wave trough passages over Lake Ontario was formed and subsequently compared with radar imagery to identify interaction events. Of 184 events, nearly half featured precipitation in shore-parallel bands (SPBs) common to Lake Ontario in westerly winds. These events can be particularly challenging to forecast due to locally intense precipitation and extreme horizontal precipitation gradients. To better understand how SPBs respond to short-wave trough passages, changes in the inland extent, meridional location, and intensity of precipitation were systematically analyzed. Inland extent generally increased when a short-wave trough axis was located over western Lake Ontario. The majority of SPBs moved southward throughout a trough passage. During an intense SPB event on 7 January 2014, the depth of a lake-induced mixed layer oscillated over 100 hPa during a short-wave trough passage; a response to midlevel vertical motion associated with curvature vorticity advection by the thermal wind. When the precipitating region is subject to ascent associated with an upshear short-wave trough, differential cooling between the lake-induced mixed layer and the relatively dry upper troposphere weakens the capping inversion. This allows the mixed layer to grow vertically, increasing precipitation rates. As the short-wave trough moves downshear, the capping inversion strengthens, descends, and precipitation is suppressed. In a semiobjective analysis of precipitation intensity, this was the typical response of an SPB to a short-wave trough passage.																			0882-8156	1520-0434				OCT	2025	40	10					2079	2087		10.1175/WAF-D-24-0247.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/WAF-D-24-0247.1													WOS:001588342900003

Coldwater, stenothermic fishes that spawn in winter may be at the highest risk of being negatively impacted by predicted future climate warming. To investigate this subject, we tested the impact of temperature on the embryonic and larval stages of coldwater, stenothermic salmonid whitefishes (coregonines). Embryos of two coregonine species from Upper Lake Constance (a large, deep perialpine lake bordering Austria, Germany and Switzerland) were incubated at three temperatures approximating historic and potential future water temperatures. After hatching, larvae from all incubation treatments were transferred to two rearing temperature treatments. Hatching times were advanced by higher temperatures, whilst mortality and larval performance responses to higher temperatures were generally negative, suggesting that future climate warming will reduce coregonine recruitment in Upper Lake Constance. The two species tested varied in their specific responses to temperature and in the sensitivity of their responses to temperature. Additionally, we found that incubation temperature affected the performance of coregonine larvae up to two and a half months after hatching. Using our data on hatching times, we infer that future climate change could advance coregonine phenologies in Upper Lake Constance by up to two weeks by the end of the 21st century.

J	Wang, YC; Pang, ZH				Wang, Yingchun; Pang, Zhonghe			Heat flux in volcanic and geothermal areas: Methods, principles, applications and future directions	GONDWANA RESEARCH												The measurement and assessment of heat flux in volcanic and geothermal areas are crucial to studying the thermodynamic process, locating the activity of a geothermal field, evaluating geothermal resources, and assessing volcanic hazards. Several methods exist for conducting heat flux measurements, including assessing the soil temperature gradient, thermal infrared remote sensing, ground calorimeter, and other direct calorimetric methods; as well as assessing soil CO2 flux, chloride inventory balance, eddy covariance, and other indirect calorimetric methods; and integrated methods from those mentioned above. Here, we review the history, basic principles, field operation procedures, suitability, and application of these heat flux measurement methods. The relationship between these direct and indirect calorimetric methods and the conduction, convection, advection, and radiation heat transfer mechanisms near the surface are also discussed. Characterization of the intensity of heat accumulation in volcanic and geothermal areas and its potential value for heat and mass transfer near the surface are also recommended. We suggest that the soil temperature gradient and soil CO2 flux methods are promising and representative heat flux measurement methods after comparative analysis of their advantages and disadvantages, accuracy of results, relationship with the heat transfer mechanism, characterization of heat accumulation intensity, convenient operation, clear principle, wide range of characterization, and abundant application scenarios. With the increasing demand for these technologies, heat flux measurement methods can be applied in unconventional volcanic and geothermal areas, such as polar regions, the moon, and large lakes. The results are beneficial to the targeting of geothermal resources, as well as revealing the mechanism of heat and mass transfer in the upper crust. & COPY; 2022 International Association for Gondwana Research.

Such physical changes can be accompanied by shifts in plankton community structure, including changes in relative abundances and depth distributions. Here we analyzed 45 years of data from Lake Baikal, the world's oldest, deepest, and most voluminous lake, to assess long-term trends in the depth distribution of pelagic phytoplankton and zooplankton. Surface water temperatures in Lake Baikal increased steadily between 1955 and 2000, resulting in a stronger thermal gradient within the top 50 m of the water column. In conjunction with these physical changes our analyses reveal significant shifts in the daytime depth distribution of important phytoplankton and zooplankton groups. The relatively heavy diatoms, which often rely on mixing to remain suspended in the photic zone, shifted downward in the water column by 1.90 m y(-1), while the depths of other phytoplankton groups did not change significantly. Over the same time span the density-weighted average depth of most major zooplankton groups, including cladocerans, rotifers, and immature copepods, exhibited rapid shifts toward shallower positions (0.57-0.75 m y(-1)). As a result of these depth changes the vertical overlap between herbivorous copepods (Epischura baikalensis) and their algal food appears to have increased through time while that for cladocerans decreased. We hypothesize that warming surface waters and reduced mixing caused these ecological changes. Future studies should examine how changes in the vertical distribution of plankton might impact energy flow in this lake and others.

J	Cordova, CE; Scott, L; Chase, BM; Chevalier, M				Cordova, Carlos E.; Scott, Louis; Chase, Brian M.; Chevalier, Manuel			Late Pleistocene-Holocene vegetation and climate change in the Middle Kalahari, Lake Ngami, Botswana	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Pollen, spores, and microscopic charcoal from a sediment core from Lake Ngami, in the Middle Kalahari, reflect paleovegetation and paleoclimatic conditions over the last 16,600 cal years BP. The location of Lake Ngami allows for the receipt of moisture sourced from the Indian and/or Atlantic oceans, which may have influenced local rainfall or long distance water transport via the Okavango system. We interpret results of statistical analyses of the pollen data as showing a complex, dynamic system wherein variability in tropical convective systems and local forcing mechanisms influence hydrological changes. Our reconstructions show three primary phases in the regional precipitation regime: 1) an early period of high but fluctuating summer rainfall under relatively cool conditions from similar to 16,600-12,500 cal BP, with reduced tree to herb and shrub ratio; 2) an episode of significantly reduced rainfall centered around c. 11,400 cal BP, characterized by an increase in xeric Asteraceae pollen, but persistent aquatic elements, suggesting less rainfall but cool conditions and lower evaporation that maintained water in the basin; and 3) a longer phase of high, but fluctuating rainfall from 9000 cal BP to present with more woody savanna vegetation (Vachellia (Acacia) and Combretaceae). We propose a model to relate these changes to increased Indian Ocean-sourced moisture in the late Pleistocene due to a southerly position of the African rain belt, a northerly contraction of tropical systems that immediately followed the Younger Dryas, and a subsequent dominance of local insolation forcing, modulated by changes in the SE Atlantic basin.

Under calm conditions, the negatively buoyant Rhone River, entering at the eastern end of the lake, interacts with the lake density profile such that the river intrusion moves as an interflow in the thermocline layer straight out into the lake. A strong, large-scale spatially homogeneous wind that lasts for several days causes a downward thermocline tilt at the western end of the lake, coastal downwelling on the northern shore, and coastal upwelling on the southern shore. This cold-water upwelling progresses like a Kelvin wave around the lake after wind forcing ceases. When it arrives at the river inflow area, it homogenizes the lake water temperatures, and the river inflow transforms into an intrusion that spreads over the whole water column. Trapped by strong alongshore currents generated by the progressing coastal upwelling, the river plume is sharply deviated and flows along the shore in the nearshore zone, potentially bringing nutrients directly into the phototrophic near-surface layer. Following the passage of the coastal upwelling, the river inflow transforms back into an interflow. This change in inflow dynamics, which is documented for five strong wind events between June and September by combining in situ measurements, remote sensing, and numerical simulation, can be expected to occur in other large lakes with comparable wind-induced large-scale thermocline displacement.

Establishing baseline water quality for household wells within the Marcellus Shale gas region, Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania, USA	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												Flowback fluids associated with hydraulic fracturing shale gas extraction are a potential source of contamination for shallow aquifers. In the Marcellus Shale region of northeastern Pennsylvania, certified water tests have been used to establish baseline water chemistry of private drinking water wells. This study investigates whether a single, certified multiparameter water test is sufficient for establishing baseline water chemistry from which possible future contamination by flowback waters could be reliably recognized. We analyzed the water chemistry (major and minor inorganic elements and stable isotopic composition) of multiple samples collected from lake, spring, and well water from 35 houses around Fiddle Lake, Susquehanna County, PA that were collected over approximately a two-year period. Statistical models estimated variance of results within and between households and tested for significant differences between means of our repeated measurements and prior certified water tests. Overall, groundwater chemistry varies more spatially due to heterogeneity of minerals within the bed-rock aquifer and due to varying inputs of road salt runoff from paved roads than it does temporally at a single location. For wells located within road salt-runoff zones, Na+ and Cl- concentrations, although elevated, are generally consistent through repeated measurements. High add neutralizing capacity (ANC) and base cation concentrations in well water sourced from mineral weathering reactions, and a uniform stable isotopic composition for well water, suggests long flowpaths for groundwater that dampen seasonal variability of most elements. Exceptions occur for two wells within road salt runoff zones that show the greatest range of concentrations for Na+ and Cl-, suggesting that these wells have a faster pathway to surficial recharge. Additionally, sampling protocols can induce variability for Fe, Mn, and Pb, making other elements identified in flowback fluids (Ba, Br, Ca, Cl, Mg, Na, Sr) more dependable indicators of contamination. Although there is general concordance between our repeated measurements and the certified test results, characterizing baseline chemistry is strengthened when results from multiple households are combined to establish regional upper baseline limits that will have a low probability of being exceeded by future samples unless conditions have changed.

J	Li, WJ; Xu, SG; Chen, XQ; Han, DN; Mu, BQ				Li, Weijia; Xu, Shiguo; Chen, Xiaoqiang; Han, Dongning; Mu, Baoquan			Influencing Factors and Nutrient Release from Sediments in the Water Level Fluctuation Zone of Biliuhe Reservoir, a Drinking Water Reservoir	WATER												Significant amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus in sediments will be released into the overlying water during the flood season in the water level fluctuation zone (WLFZ) of reservoirs that undergo periodic drying and flooding. This will result in water quality deterioration of the reservoir. In order to clarify the distribution characteristics and release behavior of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) from sediments in the WLFZ of a reservoir, this study analyzed the sediment distribution characteristics and potential exchange flux sediment-water interface(SWI) through field investigations and sediment core incubation experiments. And the main factors affecting the release of N and P through the incubation experiments in sediments of the WLFZ in the reservoir were determined. Our findings indicated that the sediment in the WLFZ serves as the primary source of NH4+-N and acts as a sink for NO2-N in the overlying water of sediment. The concentration of NH4+-N in the interstitial water of sediments is the key factor that affects the water quality of Biliuhe Reservoir. Total nitrogen content of surface sediments in the WLFZ of Biliuhe Reservoir ranges from 1052.52 +/- 49.39 to 3520.54 +/- 30.31 mg/kg. High concentrations of N pollution are the primary increased risk of eutrophication in Biliuhe Reservoir during summer. The sediment N and P release flux of BLH1 located in the main stream is 1.67 +/- 1.06 and 12.32 +/- 2.42 mg<middle dot>(m(2)<middle dot>d)(-1), respectively, which is smaller than that of BLH2 (3.27 +/- 2.15 and 15.19 +/- 2.36 mg<middle dot>(m(2)<middle dot>d)(-1), respectively), BLH3 (4.24 +/- 1.74 and 17.02 +/- 2.47 mg<middle dot>(m(2)<middle dot>d)(-1), respectively) and BLH4 (7.78 +/- 2.03 and 20.56 +/- 2.38 mg<middle dot>(m(2)<middle dot>d)(-1), respectively) located in the tributary. It indicates that the water conveyance project located in BLH1 has an impact on nutrient scouring of sediments in the WLFZ at this site. The main water environment factor affecting the release of N and P in the sediment of the WLFZ is dissolved oxygen (DO). And the Pearson correlation coefficients between TN and TP with DO were -0.838 and -0.777, respectively (p < 0.05). At the same time, the diffusion of nutrients in the sediments can be effectively inhibited by maintaining a certain DO concentration in the overlying water.

Optical and thermal satellite sensor technologies, improvements in processing algorithms and the means for large scale (e.g. 1:250,000) spatial data distribution are required for detecting both these attributes. The extensive visible, -near, -shortwave and thermal infrared (VNIR-SWIR-TIR) data archive acquired by the multi-spectral Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission Reflectance Radiometer (ASTER) provides a rich source of geoscience related imagery for geothermal exploration. Examples of generating large scale mosaicked ASTER imagery to provide province to continental mineral mapping have been undertaken in areas including such as Australia, western USA, Namibia and Zagros Mountains Iran. In addition, ASTER's thermal infrared imagery also provides night time land surface temperature (LST) estimates relevant for detecting possible geothermal related anomalies. This study outlines existing methods for the application of ASTER data for geothermal exploration in East Africa. The study area encompasses a section of the East African Rift System across the Tanzanian and Kenyan border. The area includes rugged volcanic terrain which has had geological mapping of limited coverage at detailed scales, from various heritages and mapping agencies. This study summarizes the technology, the processing methodology and initial results in applying ASTER imagery for such compositional and thermal anomaly mapping related to geothermal activity. Fields observations have been used from the geothermal springs of Lake Natron, Tanzania, and compared with ASTER derived spectral composition and land surface temperature results. Published geothermal fields within the Kenyan portion of the study area have also been incorporated into this study.

A total of 34 species belonging to the Ostracoda class of Crustacea were collected from different bodies of water in the Lake Qinghai area, and the ecological information for Recent ostracod species was studied. Among these 34 species, Cypris pubera, Eucypris dulcifons, Ilyocypris sp. 1, Ilyocypris sp. 2, Fabaeformiscandona caudata, Fabaeformiscandona hyalina, Herpetocypris reptans, Prionocypris gansenensis, Potamocypris villosa. Potamocypris smaragdina. Paralimnocythere compressa and Subulacypris sp. were first reported by us in the Lake Qinghai area. Some of the species identified exhibited cosmopolitan distributions, at least in the Holarctic region. but P. gansenensis and Ilyocypris echinata appeared to be restricted to the cold regions in northwestern China. The ecological significance of the primary ostracod species in the Lake Qinghai area was described according to the observations made during our time in the field and according to data from a number of reports. Our results indicate that the species diversity and abundance of ostracods may be related to water salinity in the Lake Qinghai area. The ecological information for ostracods can be used to distinguish different water environments and types based on the characteristics of one species or of an assemblage of several species.

The nowcasting system was used to monitor real-time meteorological conditions and thermal structures, to provide spatial information on the thermal and flow dynamics from model predictions, and to compare the predictions with the observations. The system was also able to determine whether the instruments collecting field data were performing correctly using telemetry operations. The nowcasting system was initially operated in the spring of 2009 in Yuan-Yang Lake, Taiwan. Rainstorm-induced mixing occurred due to Typhoon Morakot during August 7-9, 2009. The mixing was observed by the instruments, and the spatial distributions and temporal variations during the mixing were successfully predicted by the three-dimensional hydrodynamic lake model. A quantitative comparison of the energy balances among the heat, wind, and water inflow inputs to the lake implied that the typhoon-induced mixing was primarily caused by strong winds. The model predictions showed that the lake experienced mixing and flooding (large amounts of inflow/outflow discharges), resulting in homogenous temperatures and flows that moved to the outlet of the lake.

The remaining species were Potamothrix hammoniensis, Potamothrix bavaricus, Limnodrilus claparedeanus, Branchiura sowerbyi, Aulodrilus pigueti and Dero digitata, all of which occurred at lower densities and with restricted distributions. Regardless of sampling depth, maximum densities of oligochaetes were found in winter (up to 5,142 ind. m-2 in December) and secondarily in June. Immature Tubificidae with hair setae and mature P. heuscheri were present and dominant throughout the year. Cestode parasites were recorded infesting L. hoffmeisteri and P. heuscheri populations. Oligochaeta densities increased with depth, but low oxygen concentrations (less than 1 mg l-1) during a long period (4 months) in some basins of the lake acted as a key factor in reducing the density of worms and the species richness to one species, Potamothrix heuscheri.																			0018-8158					MAR 25	1994	278	1-3					139	149		10.1007/BF00142322	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00142322													WOS:A1994NE00500018

The results of this study reveal five ostracod zones within an 11 m sediment core taken from the central part of the lake. This sedimentary sequence reveals significant changes in both depositional and environmental conditions at local and regional scales; the oldest freshwater deposits, interpreted as the Late Pleistocene/Holocene transition, mainly comprise the species Candona neglecta, Juxilyocypris cf. schwarzbachi, Hungarocypris madaraszi, Darwinula stevensoni, and Mixtacandona sp. Although the lake had not formed at this time, it is well known that the living environment of most ostracod species is connected to flooded plains, marshes, rivers, springs, and interstitial waters. In the deepest and oldest sediments within the core, from depths between 1101 cm and 945 cm, the presence of C. neglecta and J. cf. schwarzbachi are indicative of cold water, while the dominant taxa at depths between 945 cm and 874 cm are the brackish species Cyprideis torosa and C. angulata, possibly suggesting the influence of seawater because of the presence of a permeable karstic ridge that separates the lake from the ocean. In contrast, the dominant ostracod taxa at depths between 874 cm and 813 cm are species typical of freshwater environments subject to colder climatic conditions indicating a marshy, low-energy wetland. We know that the first permanent freshwater body formed at about 8130 cal yr BP (a depth of 813 cm), while large proportions of Pseudocandona marchica, Heterocypris salina, D. stevensoni, and Metacypris cordata are all indicative of warmer, shallow waters that are rich in vegetation and have variable water level. Similarly, from 5240 cal yr BP onwards, a marine influence within the core is evidenced by the presence of Cy. torosa, while present lake water conditions (i.e., alternating seasonal changes in salinity from freshwater to brackish) were established by 2750 cal yr BP. The ostracod assemblages in sediments from Lake Vrana in Dalmatia have significant potential for reconstructing the evolution of this lake as well as for understanding environmental changes and rising sea level.

The reconstruction is based on oxygen isotopes of lacustrine diatom silica (O-18(diatom)) preserved in sediment core Co 1309, and is complemented by a diatom assemblage analysis and a survey of modern isotope hydrology. The data indicate that Lake Ladoga has existed as a freshwater reservoir since at least 10.8cal. ka BP. The O-18(diatom) values range from +29.8 to +35.0 parts per thousand, and relatively higher O-18(diatom) values around +34.7 parts per thousand between c. 7.1 and 5.7cal. ka BP are considered to reflect the Holocene Thermal Maximum. A continuous depletion in O-18(diatom) since c. 6.1cal. ka BP accelerates after c. 4cal. ka BP, indicating Middle to Late Holocene cooling that culminates during the interval 0.8-0.2cal. ka BP, corresponding to the Little Ice Age. Lake-level rises result in lower O-18(diatom) values, whereas lower lake levels cause higher O-18(diatom) values. The diatom isotope record gives an indication for a rather early opening of the Neva River outflow at c. 4.4-4.0cal. ka BP. Generally, overall high O-18(diatom) values around +33.5 parts per thousand characterize a persistent evaporative lake system throughout the Holocene. As the Lake Ladoga O-18(diatom) record is roughly in line with the 60 degrees N summer insolation, a linkage to broader-scale climate change is likely.					; Kozachek, Anna/Q-4543-2016; Ludikova, Anna/GXZ-8836-2022; Meyer, Hanno/E-2870-2016; Bailey, Hannah/AAN-9643-2021; Ekaykin, Alexey/K-9894-2015; Kozachek, Anna/JCE-4791-2023; Kostrova, Svetlana/AAF-7889-2021	Gromig, Raphael/0000-0001-9217-4259; Kostrova, Svetlana/0000-0003-1124-5559; Kozachek, Anna/0000-0002-9704-8064; Kuhn, Gerhard/0000-0001-6069-7485; Meyer, Hanno/0000-0003-4129-4706; Ludikova, Anna/0000-0001-6022-2455; 													0300-9483	1502-3885				APR	2019	48	2			SI		361	376		10.1111/bor.12385	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bor.12385													WOS:000463748900008

We analyze the population dynamics of 44 common wildlife species in relation to rainfall variation in the Nakuru Wildlife Conservancy (NWC), located in the Nakuru-Naivasha region of Kenya, based on ground total counts carried out twice each year from March 1996 to May 2015. Rainfall in the region was quasi-periodic with cycle periods dependent on the rainfall component and varying from 2.8 years for the dry season to 10.9 years for the wet season. These oscillations are associated with frequent severe droughts and food scarcity for herbivores. The trends for the 44 wildlife species showed five general patterns during 1996-2015. 1) Steinbuck, bushbuck, hartebeest and greater kudu numbers declined persistently and significantly throughout 1996-2015 and thus merit the greatest conservation attention. 2) Klipspringer, mongoose, oribi, porcupine, cheetah, leopard, ostrich and Sykes monkey numbers also decreased noticeably but not significantly between 1996 and 2015.3) Dik dik, eland, African hare, Jackal, duiker, hippo and Thom son's gazelle numbers first increased and then declined between 1996 and 2015 but only significantly for duiker and hippo. 4) Aardvark, serval cat, colobus monkey, bat-eared fox, reedbuck, hyena and baboon numbers first declined and then increased but only the increases in reedbuck and baboon numbers were significant. 5) Grant's gazelle, Grevy's zebra, lion, spring hare, Burchell's zebra, bushpig, white rhino, rock hyrax, topi, oryx, vervet monkey, guinea fowl, giraffe, and wildebeest numbers increased consistently between 1996 and 2015. The increase was significant only for rock hyrax, topi, vervet monkey, guinea fowl, giraffe and wildebeest. 6) Impala, buffalo, warthog, and waterbuck, numbers increased significantly and then seemed to level off between 1996 and 2015. The aggregate biomass of primates and carnivores increased overall whereas that of herbivores first increased from 1996 to 2006 and then levelled off thereafter. Aggregate herbivore biomass increased linearly with increasing cumulative wet season rainfall. The densities of the 30 most abundant species were either strongly positively or negatively correlated with cumulative past rainfall, most commonly with the early wet season component. The collaborative wildlife conservation and management initiatives undertaken on the mosaic of private, communal and public lands were thus associated with increase or no decrease in numbers of 32 and decrease in numbers of 12 of the 44 species. Despite the decline by some species, effective community based conservation is central to the future of wildlife in the NWC and other rangelands of Kenya and beyond and is crucially dependent on the good will, effective engagement and collective action of local communities, working in partnerships with various organizations, which, in NWC, operated under the umbrella of the Nakuru Wildlife Forum.

A stable mid-late Holocene monsoon climate of the central Tibetan Plateau indicated by a pollen record	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												A 9500-year Holocene pollen record from a river valley wetland of the central Tibetan Plateau reveals the history of climate fluctuations. At the beginning of the Holocene, the catchment area of the study site was covered by sparse drought-tolerant herbaceous vegetation, suggesting a climate cooler and drier than today. This period was characterised by a high rate of soil erosion as indicated by the deposition of siliciclastic sediment at the site. The environment became wetter during the early mid-Holocene around 8060-7120 cal. BP, and during which a wetland habitat dominated by sedges was developed at the site. Throughout the mid-Holocene, the wetland remained stable, with steady accumulation of organic material. A change to a slightly drier condition took place in the late Holocene, and after about 1000 cal. BP, a marked increase in drought-tolerant herbs occurred. Although no trees lived around the site, the record shows low, but steady increasing, tree pollen frequencies throughout the mid-late Holocene. This result confirms a stable, largely monsoonal, climate in central Tibet over the middle to late Holocene. It also suggests that the optimum period of monsoonal precipitation in central Tibet occurred later and lasted longer than that in the East Asian Monsoon region. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

J	Yu, SY; Zhu, C; Song, J; Qu, WZ				Yu, SY; Zhu, C; Song, J; Qu, WZ			Role of climate in the rise and fall of Neolithic cultures on the Yangtze Delta	BOREAS												Climatic changes in the Yangtze Delta have played an important role in the emergence, persistence and collapse of civilization. Archaeological excavations in the region over many years have demonstrated that there are several layers of fine sand or organic mud that interrupt the consecutive culture strata in a number of Neolithic culture sites. Continuous biostratigraphical and sedimentological records from the Maqiao cultural site, Shanghai, suggest that the fine sand and organic mud units resulted from expansion of water bodies both by sea-level fluctuations and from increased flooding during cold and humid episodes of Holocene climates. The absence of human settlement from 7240 BP to 5320 BP in the region was mainly caused by higher sea levels resulting from a warm and humid climate. The Neolithic cultures developed under conditions of lower and more stable sea level as well as warmer and dryer climates between about 4410 BP and 3250 BP. A flood-induced lake expansion interrupted the civilization in the region at about 4200 BP. Later, higher water tables and expansion of lakes between 3250 BP and AD 618 under a cold and moist climate temporarily terminated settlement on the delta. Later, during the Tang Dynasty, beginning at about AD 618, the region again became suitable for human settlement under conditions of more favourable climate and lower water tables.

Although a lot of work has been carried out to determine the location, magnitude and intensity of the 1786 earthquake, relatively little is known about the occurrence and nature of the landslide dam. In this paper, the dam was reconstructed using historic documents and geomorphic evidence. It was found that the landslide dam was about 70 m high, and it created a lake with a water volume of about 50 x 10(6) m(3) and an area of about 1.7 km(2). The landslide dam breached suddenly due to a major aftershock on June 10, 1786. The peak discharge at the dam breach was estimated using regression equations and a physically based predictive equation. The possibility of a future failure of the landslide seems high, particularly due to inherent seismic risk, and detailed geotechnical investigations are strongly recommended for evaluating the current stability of the landslide.

Using daily air and littoral water temperature data collected from Lake Tahoe, a large sub-alpine lake located in the Sierra Nevada mountains (USA), we developed and tested an empirical approach for constructing models designed to estimate site-specific daily surface water temperatures from daily air temperature projections generated from a regional climate model. We used cluster analysis to identify thermally distinct groups among sampled sites within the lake and then developed and independently validated a set of linked regression models designed to estimate daily water temperatures for each spatially distinct thermal group using daily air temperature data. When daily air temperatures projections, generated for 2080-2099 by a regional climate model, were used as input to these group models, projected increases in summer surface water temperatures of as much as 3 A degrees C were projected. This study demonstrates an empirical approach for generating models capable of using daily air temperature projections from established climate models to project site specific impacts on littoral surface waters within large limnetic ecosystems.

Identifying critical estuarine seagrass habitat for settlement of coastally spawned fish	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Identifying and conserving sites with consistently high settlement is necessary for protecting recruitment of coastal fish populations. We investigated the initial settlement patterns of coastally spawned juvenile fish entering 4 temperate estuaries with narrow entrances ( < 500 m wide) on the eastern coast of Australia. Habitat structure (seagrass cover, blade length and syngnathid density), landscape (patch isolation, perimeter to area ratio and distance to ocean) and hydrological factors (maximum current speed, tidal volume and modelled delivery of passive particles) were investigated as possible explanations for settlement patterns into seagrass beds. One site within Lake Macquarie and 1 site within Smiths Lake were found to have consistently high settlement of 9 coastally spawned taxa over different months and were therefore identified as settlement 'hotspots'. The magnitude of tidal volume, the modelled delivery of passive particles and patch isolation together explained 70% of variation in settlement. Sites of high settlement were characterised as (1) being near to a high-volume channel supplying an abundance of larvae and (2) being isolated from other seagrass patches to concentrate settlement. Monthly variation in settlement, while affecting species composition and total fish abundance, did not alter the relative importance of the identified hotspots, suggesting that these common factors were driving settlement across different species.

Multivariate ordination analyses were used to investigate the relationship between the distribution and abundance of chironomid species and 18 environmental variables from these lakes. Canonical correspondence analyses (CCAs) and partial CCAs showed that mean July temperature is one of the independent and significant variables explaining the second-largest amount of variance after potassium ions (KC) in 100 south-western Chinese lakes. Quantitative transfer functions were created using the chironomid assemblages for this calibration data set. The second component of the weighted-average partial least squares (WA-PLS) model produced a coefficient of determination ( r(2) (bootstrap)) of 0.63, maximum bias (bootstrap) of 5.16 and root-mean-square error of prediction (RMSEP) of 2.31 degrees C. We applied the transfer functions to a 150-year chironomid record from Tiancai Lake (26 degrees 38'3.8 N, 99 degrees 43' E; 3898m.a.s.l.), Yunnan, China, to obtain mean July temperature inferences. We validated these results by applying several reconstruction diagnostics and comparing them to a 50-year instrumental record from the nearest weather station (26 degrees 51'29.22'' N, 100 degrees 14'2.34'' E; 2390m.a.s.l.). The transfer function performs well in this comparison. We argue that this 100-lake large training set is suitable for reconstruction work despite the low explanatory power of mean July temperature because it contains a complete range of modern temperature and environmental data for the chironomid taxa observed and is therefore robust.					; Langdon, Peter/B-4682-2013; Chang, Jie/R-2763-2016; Shulmeister, James/J-2859-2015; shulmeister, james/J-2859-2015; Zhang, Youchi/M-6989-2016	Chang, Jie/0000-0001-9684-6550; Zhang, Enlou/0000-0002-8057-7760; shulmeister, james/0000-0001-5863-9462; 													1814-9324	1814-9332				MAR 8	2017	13	3					185	199		10.5194/cp-13-185-2017	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/cp-13-185-2017													WOS:000396204900001

Habitat Selection and Spawning Success of Walleyes in a Tributary to Owasco Lake, New York	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Walleyes Sander vitreus are stocked into Owasco Lake, New York, to provide a sport fishery, but the population must be sustained by annual hatchery supplementation despite the presence of appropriate habitat. Therefore, we evaluated walleye spawning success in Dutch Hollow Brook, a tributary of Owasco Lake, to determine whether early survival limited recruitment. Spawning success during spring 2006 and 2007 was evaluated by estimating egg densities from samples collected in the lower 725 m of the stream. Environmental variables were also recorded to characterize the selected spawning habitat. Drift nets were set downstream of the spawning section to assess egg survival and larval drift. We estimated that 162,596 larvae hatched in 2006. For 2007, we estimated that 360,026 eggs were deposited, with a hatch of 127,500 larvae and hatching success of 35.4%. Egg density was significantly correlated to percent cover, substrate type, and depth : velocity ratio. Two sections had significantly higher egg deposition than other areas. Adult spawning walleyes selected shallow, slow habitats with some cover and gravel substrate in the accessible reaches of Dutch Hollow Brook. Our results show that walleyes found suitable spawning habitat in Dutch Hollow Brook and that egg and larval development does not appear to limit natural reproduction.

The Chari-Logone catchment was selected because it supplies over 90% of the water input to the lake, which is the largest basin in central Africa. Two water balance simulations, one considering burning and one without, were compared from the years 2003 to 2011. For a more comprehensive assessment of the effects of burning, albedo change, which has been shown to have a significant impact on a number of environmental factors, was used as a model input for calculating potential evapotranspiration (ET). Analysis of the burning scenario showed that burning grassland, which comprises almost 75% of the total Chari-Logone land cover, causes increased ET and runoff during the dry season (November-March). Recent studies have demonstrated that there is an increasing trend in the LCB of converting shrubland, grassland, and wetlands to cropland. This change from grassland to cropland has the potential to decrease the amount of water available to water bodies during the winter. All vegetative classes in a burning scenario showed a decrease in ET during the wet season. Although a decrease in annual precipitation in global circulation processes such as the El Nino Southern Oscillation would cause droughts and induce wildfires in the Sahel, the present study shows that a decrease in ET by the human-induced burning would cause a severe decrease in precipitation as well.					; Gatebe, Charles/G-7094-2011; Abdollahi, Khodayar/C-6050-2012; Abdollahi, Khodayar/U-1572-2019	Ellison, Luke/0000-0002-9998-2512; Lee, Jejung/0000-0002-8253-3710; Abdollahi, Khodayar/0000-0001-7274-0823														2673-4834				JUN	2021	2	2					340	356		10.3390/earth2020020	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/earth2020020													WOS:001109228100001

WATERBIRD DISTRIBUTION PATTERNS AND ENVIRONMENTALLY IMPACTED FACTORS IN RECLAIMED COASTAL WETLANDS OF THE EASTERN END OF NANHUI COUNTY, SHANGHAI, CHINA	ACTA ZOOLOGICA ACADEMIAE SCIENTIARUM HUNGARICAE												The eastern end of Nanhui County is one of the most important coastal wetlands for waterbirds. It is also the key reclamation site in the Yangtze River Delta. In 2005, a reclamation project was completed here. A part of reclaimed area was converted into three types of artificial wetlands: urban lake wetlands; extensive fish ponds; and abandoned wetlands. To examine the effects of different management of these wetlands on the conservation of waterbirds, a study was conducted from 2009 to 2011. A total of 41,493 waterbirds corresponding to 91 species from 15 families were recorded. Two species, Black-faced Spoonbill Platalea minor and Falcated Duck Anas falcata, meet the international conservation Ramsar criterion of >1% of global population size. The extensive fish ponds contain the highest species richness and evenness, followed by abandoned wetlands and urban lake wetlands. Non-metric Multi-dimensional Scaling ordination plot revealed partition with four distinct clusters apparent. The first and the second clusters were positively correlated with deep water area, anthropogenic disturbance, distance to the seawall, and mean water level. The third cluster had no direct relationship with any environmental factors. The fourth cluster was correlated with vegetation area, shallow water area, and bare muddy area.

Modeled aerosol nitrate formation pathways during wintertime in the Great Lakes region of North America	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Episodic wintertime particle pollution by ammonium nitrate is an important air quality concern across the Midwest U. S. Understanding and accurately forecasting PM2.5 episodes are complicated by multiple pathways for aerosol nitrate formation, each with uncertain rate parameters. Here, the Community Multiscale Air Quality model (CMAQ) simulated regional atmospheric nitrate budgets during the 2009 LADCO Winter Nitrate Study, using integrated process rate (IPR) and integrated reaction rate (IRR) tools to quantify relevant processes. Total nitrate production contributing to PM2.5 episodes is a regional phenomenon, with peak production over the Ohio River Valley and southern Great Lakes. Total nitrate production in the lower troposphere is attributed to three pathways, with 57% from heterogeneous conversion of N2O5, 28% from the reaction of OH and NO2, and 15% from homogeneous conversion of N2O5. TNO3 formation rates varied day-to-day and on synoptic timescales. Rate-limited production does not follow urban-rural gradients and NOx emissions due, to counterbalancing of urban enhancement in daytime HNO3 production with nocturnal reductions. Concentrations of HNO3 and N2O5 and nighttime TNO3 formation rates have maxima aloft (100-500 m), leading to net total nitrate vertical flux during episodes, with substantial vertical gradients in nitrate partitioning. Uncertainties in all three pathways are relevant to wintertime aerosol modeling and highlight the importance of interacting transport and chemistry processes during ammonium nitrate episodes, as well as the need for additional constraint on the system through field and laboratory experiments.					; Spak, Scott/B-7331-2008; Stanier, Charles/D-4307-2016	Stanier, Charles/0000-0001-9924-0853; Spak, Scott/0000-0002-8545-1411; 													2169-897X	2169-8996				NOV 16	2014	119	21					12420	12445		10.1002/2014JD022320	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2014JD022320													WOS:000345696600007

Late-moulting Black-necked Grebes Podiceps nigricollis show greater body mass in the face of failing food supply	IBIS												From August to December, thousands of Black-necked Grebes Podiceps nigricollis concentrate during the flightless moult period in salt ponds in the Odiel Marshes, southern Spain, where they feed on the brine shrimp Artemia parthenogenetica. We predicted that because Black-necked Grebes moulted in a food-rich, predator-free environment, there would be no net loss of body mass caused by the use of fat stored to meet energy needs during remigial feather replacement (as is the case for some other diving waterbirds). However, because the food resource disappears in winter, we predicted that grebes moulting later in the season would put on more body mass prior to moult because of the increasing risk of an Artemia population crash before the moult period is completed. Body mass determinations of thousands of birds captured during 2000-2010 showed that grebes in active wing-moult showed greater mass with date of capture. Early-moulting grebes were significantly lighter at all stages than late-moulting birds. Grebes captured with new feathers post-moult were significantly lighter than those in moult. This is the first study to support the hypothesis that individual waterbirds adopt different strategies in body mass accumulation according to timing of moult: early-season grebes were able to acquire an excess of energy over expenditure and accumulate fat stores while moulting. Delayed moulters acquired greater fat stores in advance of moult to contribute to energy expenditure for feather replacement and retained extra stores later, most likely as a bet hedge against the increasing probability of failing food supply and higher thermoregulatory demands late in the season. An alternative hypothesis, that mass change is affected by a trophically transmitted cestode using brine shrimps as an intermediate host and Black-necked Grebes as final host, was not supported by the data.					; Sanchez, Marta I/E-9723-2010; Green, Andy/A-5189-2008; Ramo, Cristina/B-9958-2013; Sánchez, Marta/E-9723-2010	Green, Andrew John/0000-0002-1268-4951; Amat, Juan A./0000-0003-1685-1056; Sanchez, Marta I/0000-0002-8349-5410; Ramo, Cristina/0000-0002-0897-4294; Sanchez, Marta I./0000-0003-1461-4786													0019-1019	1474-919X				OCT	2013	155	4					814	822		10.1111/ibi.12075	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ibi.12075													WOS:000324544200010

This semi-arid region records a sequence of Quaternary climatic changes, at times much wetter, at times much drier than today. A morphostratigraphic sequence defines episodic formation of dunes and related sediments reflecting past hydrologic and climatic changes which caused them. Thermoluminescence dating provides a broad temporal framework identifying major hydrologic changes of the past 300 ka. Ancient foreshore dunes define shorelines of mega-lake phases, the largest of which covered some 6500 km(2) with ages near 300 ka. Later lacustral expansions near 200 and 100 ka, reflect wet phases broadly comparable to marine isotope stages 7 and 5 with a trend towards increasing aridity through time. Longitudinal quartz dune formed within the mega-lake confines between successive wet phases with at least two dune building episodes near (or just before) 230 and 70 ka. Monsoon activity today produces short-lived flood events such as recorded in 1993. Climates of the mega-lake phases need not be drastically different from today's although a substantial increase in the frequency of high magnitude events was certainly involved.

J	Ayenew, T				Ayenew, Tenalem			The distribution and hydrogeological controls of fluoride in the groundwater of central Ethiopian rift and adjacent highlands	ENVIRONMENTAL GEOLOGY												Occurrence of fluoride (F) in groundwater has drawn worldwide attention, since it has considerable impact on human health. In Ethiopia high concentrations of F in groundwaters used for community water supply have resulted in extensive dental and skeletal fluorosis. As a part of a broader study, the distribution of F in groundwater has been investigated, and compared with bedrock geology and pertinent hydrochemical variables. The result indicates extreme spatial variations. High F concentration is often associated with active and sub-active regional thermal fields and acidic volcanics within high temperature rift floor. Variations in F can also be related to changes in calcium concentration resulting from dissolution of calcium minerals and mixing with waters of different chemical composition originated from variable hydrogeological environment across the rift valley. The concentration of F dramatically declines from the rift towards the highlands with the exception of scattered points associated with thermal springs confined in local volcanic centers. There are also interactions of F-rich alkaline lakes and the surrounding groundwater. Meteoric waters recharging volcanic aquifers become enriched with respect to F along the groundwater flow path from highland recharge areas to rift discharge areas. Locally wells drilled along large rift faults acting as conduits of fresh highland waters show relatively lower F. These areas are likely to be possible sources of better quality waters within the rift. The result of this study has important implications on site selection for water well drilling.																			0943-0105					MAY	2008	54	6					1313	1324		10.1007/s00254-007-0914-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00254-007-0914-4													WOS:000255745700019

The lake is surrounded by many palaeoshorelines evidencing former lake-level changes, most likely triggered by changes in meltwater flux. This hypothesis was tested by interpreting the isotope ratios of Radix shells together with delta O-18 values of Ostracoda and of authigenic aragonite. The mean delta O-18 values of Radix and Ostracoda fall along the same long-term trend indicating a change in the isotopic composition of precipitation, which contributed to the glaciers in the catchment as snow and finally as melt water to the lake. The sclerochronological delta O-18 and delta C-13 patterns in Radix shells provide seasonal weather information, which is discussed in context with previously proposed climatic changes during the last 4,200 cal yr BP. The period between similar to 4,200 and 3,000 cal yr BP was characterized by stepwise glacier advance in the catchment most likely due to a precipitation surplus. Subsequently the climate remained relatively cold but the lake level fluctuated, as indicated by ostracod shell isotope data. From similar to 1,800 cal yr BP the sclerochronological patterns provide evidence for increasing melt water flux and transport of allochthonous carbon into the lake, most likely due to an accelerated glacier retreat. The period around 1,500 cal yr BP was characterized by strong warming, increasing meltwater flux, glacier retreat and an increasing lake level. Warm conditions continued until similar to 500 cal yr I'P probably representing the end of the Medieval Warm Period. A short relatively cold (dry?) period and a lower lake level are assumed for similar to 350 cal yr BP, possibly an analogue to the Maunder Minimum cooling in the North Atlantic region. Our results show that the lake system is complex, and that changes were triggered by external forcing and feedbacks. The similarity of delta O-18 values in Radix and ostracod shells demonstrates that both archives provide complementary information.

John Jeremiah Bigsby, MD: British Army physician and pioneer North American geologist	HISTORY OF GEOLOGY AND MEDICINE	Geological Society Special Publication											In the years from 1817 to 1825 when Dr John Bigsby was stationed in Canada with the British Army, he studied the geology from the lower St Lawrence Valley to the centre of the continent. In sedimentary strata of the Great Lakes, he collected a wealth of fossils, many of unusual size. He described the mineralogy of the Canadian Shield, recognizing the igneous origin of the basalt precipices of the north shore of Lake Superior. In 1819 when the International Boundary Commission was surveying the western end of Lake Erie, the whole staff fell ill with malarial fevers and some died. Bigsby was appointed in 1820 as medical officer to the Commission. He accompanied the British survey team from 1820 to 1823 to provide medical care. In his leisure time he collected fossils from the shores of the Great Lakes. In 1823 Bigsby travelled by canoe with the surveyors completing the survey from Lake Superior to Lake of the Woods. During the journey he observed the great volcanic formations of that region. Bigsby returned to England in 1825, resigning from the British Army in 1830. He entered private medical practice but maintained a life-long interest in geology, particularly fossils.																			0305-8719		978-1-86239-356-1				2013	375						375	394		10.1144/SP375.20	http://dx.doi.org/10.1144/SP375.20													WOS:000343084200022

Dwarfs mature at a younger age (1+ vs. 4+) than normal spawners. They also show a much slower growth rate, a lower absolute fecundity (1009 vs. 9787 eggs), a higher relative fecundity (32.2 vs. 11.8 eggs/g), and a smaller ovarian egg diameter (1.60 vs. 2.63 mm). Four morphometric variables out of the 13 measured differed significantly between the two forms, including the length and depth of the caudal peduncle and the diameter of the orbit; six out of the seven meristic variables that were enumerated also differed between the two forms, including the number of gillrakers on the first gill arch (dwarfs, 24.7; normal whitefish, 25.9). Reproductive isolation is virtually nonexistent, the two forms using the same spawning site, with a minimal time lag between their mean dates of egg deposition (1983: normal whitefish, November 15 and dwarfs, November 22; 1984: normals, November 9 and dwarfs, November 12).

A Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model was created to determine the effectiveness of agricultural Best Management Practices (BMPs) funded through the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative. The model was calibrated at the monthly time-step for flow, sediment, dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP), total phosphorus (TP), nitrate, and total nitrogen (TN). Field- and watershed-scale sediment and nutrient reductions were calculated due to the implementation of 74 BMP combinations on dairy and cash grain rotations. Modeling results indicated that when multiple BMPs were placed on a field, especially those including filter strips and grassed waterways, sediment and nutrient loads generally were reduced more than single BMP implementation. The most effective infield practice at reducing DRP and TP on dairy fields was a combination of 5 different BMPs: cover crops, crop rotation, nutrient management plan, reduced tillage, and a filter strip. Conservation cover was the single most effective practice at reducing sediment and nutrient yields. Sediment and nutrient loads decreased at the watershed scale as the quantity and coverage of BMPs increased. When all contracted BMPs were simulated at the watershed scale, sediment loads were reduced 2%, while TP, DRP, TN and nitrate loads were reduced 20%, 9%, 24%, and 17%, respectively. Modeling scenarios also indicated that over-winter manure storage was important to keep soluble nutrients out of waterways.

S.; Doledec, Sylvain; Feio, Maria Joao			Chironomidae traits and life history strategies as indicators of anthropogenic disturbance	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												In freshwater ecosystems, Chironomidae are currently considered indicators of poor water quality because the family is often abundant in degraded sites. However, it incorporates taxa with a large ecological and physiological diversity and different sensitivity to impairment. Yet, the usual identification of Chironomidae at coarse taxonomic levels (family or subfamily) masks genus and species sensitivities. In this study, we investigate the potential of taxonomic and functional (traits) composition of Chironomidae to detect anthropogenic disturbance. In this context, we tested some a priori hypotheses regarding the ability of Chironomidae taxonomic and trait compositions to discriminate Mediterranean streams affected by multiple stressors from least-disturbed streams. Both taxonomic and Eltonian trait composition discriminated sites according to their disturbance level. Disturbance resulted in the predicted increase of Chironomidae with higher number of stages with hibernation/diapause and of taxa with resistance forms and unpredicted increase of the proportion of taxa with longer life cycles and few generations per year. Life history strategies (LHS), corresponding to multivoltine Chironomidae that do not invest in hemoglobin and lack strong spring synchronization, were well adapted to all our Mediterranean sites with highly changeable environmental conditions. Medium-size animals favored in disturbed sites where the Mediterranean hydrological regime is altered, but the reduced number of larger-size/carnivore Chironomids suggests a limitation to secondary production. Results indicate that Chironomidae genus and respective traits could be a useful tool in the structural and functional assessment of Mediterranean streams. The ubiquitous nature of Chironomidae should be also especially relevant in the assessment of water bodies naturally poor in other groups such as the Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera, such as the lowland rivers with sandy substrates, lakes, or reservoirs.

J	Akçinar, SC; Taskavak, E				Akcinar, Salim Can; Taskavak, Ertan			Population size and structure of the African Softshell Turtle, Trionyx triunguis, in Dalaman, southwestern Turkey	ZOOLOGY IN THE MIDDLE EAST												We assessed the size of the population of the African Softshell Turtle, Trionyx triunguis, in Dalaman (Mugla, Turkey), which is considered to be the largest population of the species in the Mediterranean, by using the Jolly-Seber mark-recapture method. A total of 415 individuals were caught during the summer months of 2009 to 2011, of which 148 were recaptures. From 267 marked individuals, 148 (55%) were male, 69 (26%) were female and 50 (19%) were juveniles and subadults of indeterminate sex. The male: female ratio was calculated to be 2.14:1. By using Model A' of the Jolly-Seber mark-recapture method, which includes deaths but no immigration, the mean population size in Kukurt and Kucukdalyan (Kargin) lakes, together with Tersakan and Taslicay creeks, were estimated to be 396 +/- 36. Based on this estimation, the population density was calculated to be 14 turtles/ha. Approximately 67.4 % of the estimated population was marked. The mean capture probability (p) and mean survival ratio (Phi) were 0.094 +/- 0.009 and 0.957 +/- 0.076, respectively. Our results showed that the species' population size is larger than previously estimated based on visual counts. The status "Vulnerable" C2a of the IUCN Red Data Book categories seems therefore more appropriate for the Mediterranean subpopulation of Trionyx triunguis than "Endangered" C2a.

We found that complex interactions among adult demographics, size-selective predation, and overwinter mortality regulate the number of largemouth bass surviving the first year of life. The largest recruitment events required at least a moderate number of adults, but a large number of adults was not sufficient to produce a large cohort of largemouth bass. Predation was controlled by the number of both adult and juvenile bass and was not strongly correlated with reproductive output. Overwinter mortality was size dependent, strongly affecting bass entering the winter at <50-60 mm in length, and likely the result of starvation. Predation and overwinter mortality interacted with spawning date and growth rate to produce variable but predictable patterns of first year survival. At high adult and juvenile densities, predation regulates first year survival. At low; adult and juvenile densities, first year survival was regulated by adult demographics and interactions among spawning date, growth rates, and overwinter mortality. Although we can forecast coarse patterns of cohort survival, the survival of individual fish was more difficult to predict because length and age were not highly correlated.

However, this potential has not been fully realised since the only available long sediment core from the lake ('SG93') was extracted from a single bore hole and was therefore interrupted by gaps of unknown duration between successive core sections. In the summer of 2006, a new sediment core (SGO6') was recovered from the lake. Four separate boreholes were drilled and the parallel sets of cores recovered were found to overlap completely, without gaps between segments. This new record provides the ability to test existing atmospheric radiocarbon calibration models, as well as to assess the scale of inter-regional leads and lags in palaeoclimatic changes over the last Glacial-Interglacial cycle. Multi-disciplinary analyses from SGO6 are still ongoing, but a reliable description of the sedimentary sequence needs to be provided to the wider science community before major outputs from the project are released, thereby allowing fully-informed critical evaluation of all subsequent releases of data based on the SGO6 record. In this paper, we report key litho-stratigraphic information concerning the SGO6 sediment core, highlighting changes in the clarity of annual laminations (varves) with depth, and possible implications for the mechanism of the climate change. We also discuss the potential of the SGO6 record to meet the fundamental goals of the INQUA-INTIMATE project. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Edible wild plants growing in contaminated floodplains: implications for the issuance of tribal consumption advisories within the Grand Lake watershed of northeastern Oklahoma, USA	ENVIRONMENTAL GEOCHEMISTRY AND HEALTH												Metal releases from the Tri-State Mining District (TSMD) that is located in southwestern Missouri, southeastern Kansas, and northeastern Oklahoma, have contaminated floodplain soils within the Neosho and Spring river watersheds of the Grand Lake watershed. Since the Oklahoma portion of the watershed lies within ten tribal jurisdictions, the potential accumulation of metals within plant species that are gathered and consumed by tribal members, as well as the resulting metal exposure risks to tribal human health, was a warranted concern for further investigation. Within this study, a total of 36 plant species that are commonly consumed by tribes were collected from floodplain areas that were previously demonstrated to have elevated soil metal concentrations relative to reference sites. A significant, positive correlation was shown for metal concentrations in plant tissues versus soil (n = 258; Cd: R = 0.72, p = 0.00; Pb: R = 0.52, p = 0.00; and Zn: R = 0.70, p = 0.00). Additionally, a significant difference in metal concentration distributions existed between reference and impacted plant samples (n = 210, p = 0.00 for all metals). These results proved that floodplain soils are a major contamination pathway for metal accumulation within plants, and the source of metal contamination is the result of mining releases from the TSMD. Metal accumulation within plants was found to vary according to specific metal and plant species. The lowest dietary exposure out of all plant organs sampled were associated with fruit, whereas the highest was associated with roots, stem/leaves, and low-lying leafy greens. Metals in plants were compared to weekly dietary intake limits established by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives. Based on specific serving sizes established within this study for tribal children and adults, many plant species had sufficient concentrations to warrant tribal consumption restrictions within the floodplains of Elm Creek, Grand Lake, Lost Creek, Spring River, and Tar Creek. Importantly, these results highlighted the necessity for the issuance of plant consumption advisories for tribal communities in the watershed. A consumption restriction guide on the number of allowable servings of each species per week at specific streams was developed within this study for tribal children and adults. Results also demonstrated that soil metal concentrations do not need to be exceptionally elevated relative to reference sites in order for plants to accumulate sufficient metal concentrations to exceed dietary limits for one serving. Therefore, the exposure risk associated with the consumption of plants cannot be accurately predicted solely from metal concentrations within soils, but must be based on metal concentrations within specific plant tissues on a site-by-site basis. A weekly consumption scenario was created within this study in order to better understand the potential metal dietary exposures to child and adult tribal members who consume multiple servings of multiple plant species per day, as well as benthic invertebrates and fish from the watershed. These findings demonstrated that plants pose a greater consumption exposure risk for tribal members than benthic invertebrates or fish. Therefore, without the consideration of exposure risks associated with the consumption of plants within future human health risk assessments, tribal health risks will be severely underestimated.																			0269-4042	1573-2983				JUN	2018	40	3					999	1025		10.1007/s10653-017-9960-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10653-017-9960-3								28466201					WOS:000432993200005
J	Laurion, I; Mladenov, N				Laurion, Isabelle; Mladenov, Natalie			Dissolved organic matter photolysis in Canadian arctic thaw ponds	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												The abundant thaw lakes and ponds in the circumarctic receive a new pool of organic carbon as permafrost peat soils degrade, which can be exposed to significant irradiance that potentially increases as climate warms and ice cover shortens. Exposure to sunlight is known to accelerate the transformation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) into molecules that can be more readily used by microbes. We sampled the water from two common classes of ponds found in the ice-wedge system of continuous permafrost regions of Canada, polygonal and runnel ponds, and followed the transformation of DOM over 12 days by looking at dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration and DOM absorption and fluorescence properties. The results indicate a relatively fast decay of color (3.4 and 1.6% loss d(-1) of absorption at 320 nm for the polygonal and runnel pond, respectively) and fluorescence (6.1 and 8.3% loss d(-1) of total fluorescent components, respectively) at the pond surface, faster in the case of humic-like components, but insignificant losses of DOC over the observed period. This result indicates that direct DOM mineralization (photochemical production of CO2) is apparently minor in thaw ponds compared to the photochemical transformation of DOM into less chromophoric and likely more labile molecules with a greater potential for microbial mineralization. Therefore, DOM photolysis in arctic thaw ponds can be considered as a catalytic mechanism, accelerating the microbial turnover of mobilized organic matter from thawing permafrost and the production of greenhouse gases, especially in the most shallow ponds. Under a warming climate, this mechanism will intensify as summers lengthen.

Effects of Recruitment, Growth, and Exploitation on Walleye Population Size Structure in Northern Wisconsin Lakes	JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												We evaluated the dynamics of walleye Sander vitreus population size structure, as indexed by the proportional size distribution (PSD) of quality-length fish, in Escanaba Lake during 1967-2003 and in 204 other lakes in northern Wisconsin during 1990-2011. We estimated PSD from angler-caught walleyes in Escanaba Lake and from spring electrofishing in 204 other lakes, and then related PSD to annual estimates of recruitment to age-3, length at age 3, and annual angling exploitation rate. In Escanaba Lake during 1967-2003, annual estimates of PSD were highly dynamic, growth (positively) explained 35% of PSD variation, recruitment explained only 3% of PSD variation, and exploitation explained only 7% of PSD variation. In 204 other northern Wisconsin lakes during 1990-2011, PSD varied widely among lakes, recruitment (negatively) explained 29% of PSD variation, growth (positively) explained 21% of PSD variation, and exploitation explained only 4% of PSD variation. We conclude that population size structure was most strongly driven by recruitment and growth, rather than exploitation, in northern Wisconsin walleye populations. Studies of other species over wide spatial and temporal ranges of recruitment, growth, and mortality are needed to determine which dynamic rate most strongly influences population size structure of other species. Our findings indicate a need to be cautious about assuming exploitation is a strong driver of walleye population size structure.

J	Li, HX; Zhang, WH; Yan, HM; Gao, P				Li, Huixiang; Zhang, Weihao; Yan, Huimin; Gao, Pan			Understanding the toxicity risk of antibiotic emissions of aquaculture from the perspective of fluctuations concentration	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Organisms are generally exposed to target contaminant with stable concentrations in traditional ecotoxicological studies. However, it is difficult to truly represent the dynamics and complexity of actual aquatic pollution for risk management. Contaminants may enter nearby aquatic systems in pulsed exposure, thus resulting in that aquatic organisms will be exposed to contaminants at fluctuating concentrations. Especially during the season of summer, due to the changes in displacement or periodic emissions of veterinary antibiotics in aquaculture, algal blooms occur frequently in surrounding waters, thus leading to eutrophication of the water. Florfenicol (FFC) is currently widely used as a veterinary antibiotic, but the aquatic ecological risks of FFC under concentration fluctuations are still unknown. Therefore, the acute exposure, chronic exposure and pulsed exposure effects of FFC on Microcystis aeruginosa were investigated to comprehensively evaluate the ecological risk of FFC and raise awareness of the pulsed exposure mode. Results indicated that the toxic effects of FFC on M . aeruginosa were dominated by exposure mode, exposure duration, exposure frequency, and exposure concentration. The maximum growth inhibition rate of the 10 mu g/L FFC treatment amounted to 4.07% during chronic exposure of 18 days. However, the growth inhibition rate decreased from 55.1% to 19.31% when algae was exposure to 10 mu g/L FFC during the first pulsed exposure (8 h). Therefore, when the concentration of FFC was equal under chronic and pulsed exposure, FFC exhibited greater toxicity on M. aeruginosa in short pulsed exposure than in continuous exposure. In addition, repetitive pulsed exposure strengthened the resistance of M. aeruginosa on FFC. The adaptive regulation of algae was related to the duration and frequency of exposure. Above results suggested that traditional toxicity assessments lacked consideration for fluctuating concentrations during pollutant emissions, thus underestimating the environmental risk of contaminant. This investigation aims to facilitate the standardization of pulsed exposure.																			0269-7491	1873-6424				JUN 15	2024	351								124024	10.1016/j.envpol.2024.124024	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2024.124024		MAY 2024						38685554					WOS:001239178000001
J	Wang, YF; Sugiyama, S				Wang, Yefan; Sugiyama, Shin			Supraglacial lake evolution on Tracy and Heilprin Glaciers in northwestern Greenland from 2014 to 2021	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Supraglacial lakes form on the Greenland ice sheet during the melting season as meltwater accumulates in topographic depressions on the surface. They have the potential to increase ablation by reducing albedo and enhance ice flow when water drains to the bed. Despite recent progress in understanding the surface hydrology of the Greenland ice sheet, the seasonal and year-to-year variations of supraglacial lakes remain poorly understood. Here, we employed a machine learning method trained with random forest classifiers on Landsat 8 and Sentinel -2 imagery within Google Earth Engine for detecting supraglacial lakes. We applied this method to two large marine -terminating glaciers (Heilprin Glacier and Tracy Glacier) in northwestern Greenland to investigate the distribution, inter -annual and seasonal evolutions of supraglacial lakes between 2014 and 2021. Over the eight study years, cumulated maximum lake extent on Heilprin Glacier (22.84 km2) was approximately three times larger than that of Tracy Glacier (7.60 km2) despite the similarity in the glacier areas (654 km2 and 540 km2). The lake extent exhibited significant interannual variability controlled by summer PDD (sum of positive degree days), and the upper limit of lake formation coincided approximately with ELA (equilibrium line altitude). Greater lake areas were observed in 2016 and 2019, but obviously below -average areas in 2017-2018. The variabilities were pronounced in the region above 800 m a.s.l., particularly at Tracy Glacier. On the seasonal scale, lakes begin forming in early- to mid -June and disappear toward the end of August. The lake formation was triggered by the initiation of runoff in the regions below 800 m a.s.l., while it coincided with the onset of surface melt at the higher elevations due to the presence of ice/snow-buried lakes. Cascading rapid lake drainage events were observed in the mid -elevation areas (400-800 m a.s.l.) of Heilprin Glacier, which induced an abrupt decrease in the lake area at the beginning of July in the years of 2019 and 2020. Our study demonstrates the potential of the machine learning method to analyze supraglacial lakes in dense satellite images. The results imply inland expansion of supraglacial lakes under warming climate in Greenland and a possible interaction between draining lake water and glacier dynamics.					; Sugiyama, Shin/C-2511-2012	Wang, Yefan/0000-0003-1852-2176; 													0034-4257	1879-0704				MAR 15	2024	303								114006	10.1016/j.rse.2024.114006	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2024.114006		JAN 2024											WOS:001175758700001

P. akamusi larvae can migrate deep into the sediment (> 30 cm) during summer where is no oxygen. However, to our knowledge, the specific adaptive tactics of its tube-dwelling life (> 30 cm) and underlying mechanisms why this species is favored by nutrient-rich lakes remain limited. With the understanding above-mentioned issues, we can provide important information for the development of sensitive biomonitoring. We examined monthly morphological dynamics and physiological adaptations of P. akamusi to anoxic conditions, and environmental relationships of the species abundance in a subtropical eutrophic lake. Results of our experiments indicated that this species presented extremely low fuel consumption at a state of estivation when the larvae dwelt in deep sediment, and conducted anaerobic respiration, with ethanol as a major metabolite, to withstand long term anoxic conditions. Additionally, in our field study, the abundance of P. akamusi correlated positively with most nutrient-related variables, indicating that this species can serve as sentinel organisms of nutrient enrichment. We suggest that the high tolerance to anoxia and detritivorous diet of P. akamusi larvae may allow the species to benefit from nutrient enrichment. The vertical niche differentiation and the avoidance of benthivorous predator by vertical sediment migration behavior may also contribute to its high dominance in eutrophic freshwaters.

J	Dirszowsky, RW; Wilson, KM				Dirszowsky, Randy W.; Wilson, Kimberly M.			Biogeochemical evidence of eutrophication and metal contamination of Frame Lake, City of Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, Canada	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												The sediments of Frame Lake, Yellowknife, NWT were examined to evaluate human impact due to urbanization and mining and provide background information for potential remediation efforts. Physical and geochemical analyses were carried out on cores from two sites targeting the lake's deep basins. Pb-210 analysis was used to establish chronological control and determine recent sedimentation rates. Frame Lake contains sediments spanning the whole of the Holocene from the time of deglaciation to the present. With the development of the city and increasing human population over the last * 80 years Frame Lake has become increasingly eutrophic. The source of nutrient loading is generalized and probably not exceptionally high; however, due to its limited depth, extensive winter ice cover and low turnover rates, the lake appears to be sensitive to the resulting biological oxygen demand. Frame Lake sediments were found to contain elevated concentrations of metals attributable to gasoline combustion (Pb), mining and ore processing (e. g. As, Cu) and other sources (Zn). While most of these elements peak below the sediment surface and contamination has decreased in recent years, concentrations remain above levels recommended for the protection of aquatic life. It is apparent that contaminants previously deposited within the catchment are still supplying the lake and in the case of As, that post-depositional translocation within the sediments is taking place.																			1866-6280	1866-6299				JAN	2016	75	1							76	10.1007/s12665-015-4852-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-015-4852-2													WOS:000370239800076

SG14 Project Members	Constraints on the Timing of Explosive Volcanism at Aso and Aira Calderas (Japan) Between 50 and 30 ka: New Insights From the Lake Suigetsu Sedimentary Record (SG14 Core)	GEOCHEMISTRY GEOPHYSICS GEOSYSTEMS												Volcanoes in the East Asian/Pacific region have been the source of some of the largest magnitude eruptions during the Late Quaternary, and accurately evaluating their eruptive histories is essential for hazard assessments. To overcome difficulties in resolving and precisely dating eruptions in the near-source realm, the high-resolution (varved) sediments of Lake Suigetsu (central Honshu, Japan) were examined for the presence of non-visible (cryptotephra) layers from 50 ka up until the 30 ka Aira-Tanzawa (AT) caldera-forming event of Aira volcano. Cryptotephra layers are four times more frequently preserved than visible markers in the Suigetsu sediments, meaning that this archive provides a unique and unprecedented record of eruptions that were dispersed over the densely populated regions of central Honshu. Major and trace element volcanic glass chemistry is used to fingerprint the ash layers and pinpoint their volcanic origin. Tephras are found throughout the investigated sediments, but the highest abundance of ash fall events are recorded between 39 and 30 ka, capturing a period of intense volcanism at calderas on Kyushu Island (Japan). The augmented Suigetsu tephrostratigraphy records at least seven eruptions from Aso caldera (southern Kyushu) that post-date the widespread ACP-4 Plinian eruption (ca. 50 ka) and four explosive events from Aira (central Kyushu) that occurred leading up to the catastrophic caldera-forming AT eruption (ca. 30 ka).					; Manning, Christina/C-1135-2013; Smith, Victoria/AAA-4152-2021; Suzuki, Takehiko/AAY-8761-2021	Albert, Paul/0000-0002-6757-1452; Kimura, Jun-Ichi/0000-0002-2677-515X; McLean, Danielle/0000-0002-5378-3067														1525-2027				AUG	2020	21	8							e2019GC008874	10.1029/2019GC008874	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2019GC008874													WOS:000577130200002

In this study, we conducted seasonal sampling and analysis of GHG concentrations and water chemistries in Xuanwu Lake, Nanjing, China. Concurrently, we observed pore water chemistry within the lake bottom sediments. Radon isotope activity in lake water was also measured. Then, this study expanded to a broad understanding of urban lake GHG emissions by conducting a meta-analysis of over 100 lakes of similar size but various types (urban vs. non-urban). Xuanwu Lake is a net source of GHG, with mean annual diffusive fluxes of 10.2 +/- 9.3 mmol center dot m-2 center dot d-1 for CO2, 3.1 +/- 0.3 mmol center dot m-2 center dot d-1 for CH4, and 12.4 +/- 1.0 mu mol center dot m-2 center dot d-1 for N2O. The lake emitted 614.9 tons of CO2, 68.6 tons of CH4, and 0.84 tons of N2O throughout the year. CO2 levels were positively correlated with dissolved organic and inorganic carbon, while CH4 peaked in winter due to increased anaerobic decomposition. N2O concentrations were strongly linked to nutrient levels. Furthermore, statistical analysis showed that urban lakes demonstrated significantly greater CH4 and N2O emissions compared to non-urban lakes. These findings emphasize the need for further research and targeted mitigation strategies to address GHG emissions from urban lakes, especially in the context of increasing anthropogenic pressures and climate change.

At present, approximately 17 % of the world's land areas are under protection, but large conservation gaps still exist. Moreover, to fulfil the global commitment of protecting 30 % of land areas by 2030, identifying potential habitats and conservation priorities for threatened species are urgently required. Therefore, this study aims to assess the habitat suitability of five species of cranes, which are internationally recognized flagship species across critical wetlands in northeast China, and to identify gaps in the current PAs network using a combination of field- based investigation and a species distribution modelling approach. Line transects were repeatedly conducted at monthly intervals to cover the entire migratory and breeding seasons, with a total length of 4622 km. Information on crane occurrences and habitat conditions were recorded during the fieldwork. Results showed that distance from lakes predominantly determined the distribution of the cranes. Winter precipitation affected stopover determination of migratory cranes, and temperature affected the distribution of breeding cranes. The analysis showed that the current PA network could not cover the entire suitable habitat for all crane species, with >50 % of suitable migratory crane habitat and approximately 20 % of suitable breeding crane habitat remaining outside of the PAs. Correspondingly, two conservation priority areas were identified that require effective conservation measures. This study provides critical information on the habitat requirements of five crane species and identifies conservation priorities so that flagship species and critical wetlands can be effectively protected.					; Storch, Ilse/N-7478-2019	Sun, Qiaoqi/0000-0002-4647-9681; 													0006-3207	1873-2917				JUN	2024	294								110638	10.1016/j.biocon.2024.110638	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2024.110638		MAY 2024											WOS:001292502600001

Material for this study was collected for three winter seasons in 39 water bodies in the Silesian Upland (southern Poland). Nine variables were used in the analysis, of which three pertained to the features of the water bodies studied (surface area, mean depth, the amount of water retained), and six pertained patterns to of ice phenomena (average near-surface water temperature during ice phenomena, average and maximum ice thickness, the number of days with ice phenomena, the number of days with ice cover, and average thickness of the snow accumulated on ice). The centroid class principal component analysis (CCPCA) method was found to be the most precise of the five methods used in the study for classifying water bodies in terms of their ice regimes. It enabled the most accurate division of the group of water bodies covered by the study in terms of their ice regimes in conjunction with their morphometric features and hydrological types. The presented method of classifying water bodies using advanced statistical methods is an original proposal, which was used for the first time in limnological research and in the analysis of ice phenomena.

J	Pikosz, M; Messyasz, B; Gabka, M				Pikosz, Marta; Messyasz, Beata; Gabka, Maciej			Functional structure of algal mat (Cladophora glomerata) in a freshwater in western Poland	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												GAMs (Generalized Additive Models) present a growth pattern for the common filamentous algae (FA) taxa in freshwater ecosystems in Poland. Tribonema, Ulothrix taxa are an early spring species. In comparison with Rhziodonium, Cladophora and Oedogbnium taxa, the algae Zygnemataceae (e.g. Zygnema, Spirogyra) occurs in waters with lower levels of nutrients, total dissolved substances and electrical conductivity. Cladophora glomerata shows different responses to environmental gradients than C rivularis, C fracta. Furthermore, the algae Cladophora glomerata (Chlorophyta, Ulvophyceae) forms a thick monoalgae mat (from the surface to the bottom) in the shallow and eutrophic Lake Oporzynskie in Wielkopolska Region in Poland (Central Europe). Detailed algal mat characteristics, physical and chemical parameters of water, and pigments in thalli were measured vertically (surface, middle, bottom) and spatially (marginal and central part) in the stationary mat phase during maximal algal growth. Temperature, dissolved oxygen and PAR irradiation significantly declined as the depth of the mat increased. Water turbidity was greater in the surface layer than in deeper parts, in contrast to the concentrations of N-NO3, N-NH4 and TDS. Pigment content in the cells of C.glomerata, cell lengths and diameters of pyrenoids changed throughout the mat, from top to bottom. The obtained data were used for statistical analyses. In conclusion: dense mats of C glomerata show a vertical stratification while the mats remain spatially homogenous. Our data suggest that mat structure be considered a biological indicator of freshwater eutrophication. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												Hjort's insights on marine fish recruitment and larval fish advection are presumed not applicable to freshwater lakes because most freshwater lakes are small. The Laurentian Great Lakes (LGL), however, are large enough for certain oceanic-type hydrodynamics, such as strong currents and upwelling, to affect the distribution and survival of larval fish and thus fall under Hjort's purview. However, there are evolutionary constraints because LGL species underwent an evolutionary bottleneck during glaciation, similar to 10 000 years BP. We consider three narratives pertinent to both the spatial scale and the evolutionary time-scale of the LGL. The first reviews recent evidence of offshore advection and subsequent cross-lake dispersal of larval and juvenile yellow perch, a coastal demersal species in Lake Michigan. The second narrative suggests that biotic interactions, rather than spatial scale itself, could account for the transition in the critical period of Lake Michigan yellow perch period from a juvenile to a larval critical period. In the third narrative, we consider whether the deep LGL lack a significant native pelagic larval fish predator. We propose that the LGL, in combination with the older World's Great Lakes, present an opportunity to explore evolution and adaptation of fish to oceanic type physical conditions.

J	Dilly, O; Munch, JC				Dilly, O; Munch, JC			Microbial biomass content, basal respiration and enzyme activities during the course of decomposition of leaf litter in a black alder (Alnus glutinosa (L) Gaertn) forest	SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY												Decomposition of leaf litter from a black alder (Alnus glutinosa (L.) Gaertn.) forest on a fen (peat soil) in Northern Germany was studied at two sites within the forest. The 'wet' site was adjacent to a lake and soil was water-saturated throughout most of the year. In contrast, the other site was substantially drier, especially in summer and therefore called the 'dry' site. The pH (H2O) value of the topsoils (horizon below litter) at the wet and dry site was 6.0 and 3.5, respectively. The litter consisted mainly of alder leaves and decomposed at different rates at the two sites. After 12 months, about 40% of the initial litter was decomposed at the dry site compared to 90% at the wet site. The water content of the litter varied seasonally, particularly at the dry site. The pH of the litter was similar to or higher than that in the underlying topsoil and decreased at the dry site after 18 months. The total C content in residual material did not change during the course of decomposition. The microbial biomass content was, with some irregularities, similar throughout the first months and then continually declined. Basal respiration decreased from an initial value of approximately 700 to 100 mu g CO2 g(-1) dry litter h(-1) after 17 months. beta-Glucosidase activity also continuously decreased during litter decomposition; protease activity decreased initially but then tended to increase. The metabolic quotient declined during the course of litter decomposition from a relatively high value to a value almost typical for soils. This decline indicates an increase in the C utilization efficiency of the microbial community as well as a shift from a zymogenous to an autochthonous microflora. Regression analyses were performed to determine correlations between properties and to evaluate factors controlling the decomposition process.

Tunka-Rex is triggered by the air-Cherenkov array Tunka-133 during clear and moonless winter nights and by the scintillator array Tunka-Grande during the remaining time. Tunka-Rex measures the radio emission from the same air-showers as Tunka-133 and Tunka-Grande, but with a higher threshold of about 100 PeV. During the first stages of its operation, Tunka-Rex has proven, that sparse radio arrays can measure air-showers with an energy resolution of better than 15% and the depth of the shower maximum with a resolution of better than 40 g/cm(2). To improve and interpret our measurements as well as to study systematic uncertainties due to interaction models, we perform radio simulations with CORSIKA and CoREAS.

During the summer, Nakamun Lake was intermittently stratified and Halfmoon Lake was weakly, thermally stratified. During the stratified periods, water overlying the sediments was anoxic, TP levels increased in the deep water, and sediments were the main source of TP, contributing 1468 and 147 kg of TP to Nakamun and Halfmoon lakes, respectively. During these same periods, internal loading to Nakamun and Halfmoon lakes (12.7 and 15.6 mg .cntdot. m-2 .cntdot. d-1, respectively) were slightly higher than the rates predicted from laboratory experiments on sediment cores (9.7 and 7.2 mg .cntdot. m-2 .cntdot. day-1, respectively). Quantitative estimates of vertical water exchange in Nakamun Lake and in-lake TP budgets for both lakes indicated that Ph released from the sediments was transported to the surface water during mixing. After 8 of the 9 mixing events that immediately followed stratified periods, [TP] increased 3-43% and 31-52% in the surface water of Nakamun and Halfmoon lakes, respectively.																			0706-652X	1205-7533					1984	41	6					845	855		10.1139/f84-101	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f84-101													WOS:A1984SY55400002

This portable kit contains three sealed reagent tubes (labeled as T1, T2 and T3), a self-made well plate, and a portable Raman spectrometer. The reagent tube T1 contains a mixture of disperser solvent and extraction solvent, which involved a 2 min sample pretreatment of DLLME process. The quick injection of solvents in tube T1 into the sample containing PAHs formed a cloudy solution immediately, which consists of fine droplets of extraction solvent dispersed entirely into aqueous phase. The enrichment factor was found to be 29.6. T2 and T3 contain methanol and 1-propanethiol-modified silver nanoparticles (PTH-Ag NPs), respectively. The liquid in the tube T3 was used to enhance the Raman signal of analytes on the self-made high-throughput micro reactor. A linear relationship between the concentration of pyrene and the relative Raman peak intensity was obtained (R-2 = 0.993). The detection limit was 0.50 mu g L-1 for pyrene. RSD of the high-throughput analysis of 12 samples was calculated as 4.8%. The ability of DLLME-SERS technique in the extraction of PAH isomers from water samples were investigated. The performance of DLLME-SERS in the recovery of pyrene from lake, spring and drinking water was also studied.

J	Liu, LX				Liu, Lixia			Factors Affecting Tufa Degradation in Jiuzhaigou National Nature Reserve, Sichuan, China	WATER												Water and tufa samples were collected from Arrow Bamboo Lake, the stream from Panda Lake to Five-Color Lake, Pearl Shoal and Shuzheng Lakes in Jiuzhaigou National Nature Reserve, China, between October 2013 and September 2014, to investigate tufa growth rate and water environment (water temperature, pH, electric conductivity, major ions and nutrients), and analyzed to explore the main causes of tufa degradation. The mean annual rate of tufa growth was low and varied within lakes, with the maximum deposit thickness of 332 mu m/y. The calcite saturation index ranged from 0.65 to 0.83. Scanning electron microscope images showed that the tufa deposits had non-isopachous structures, and diatoms were the dominant microorganisms that participated in tufa deposition. Porous and crystalline structures of deposits were linked with a high tufa growth and small amounts of diatoms. Conversely, tufa deposits with amorphous and loose structures showed a low crystal growth rate and a high number of diatoms. A one-way analysis of variance and a least significant difference test were applied to identify site differences in water chemistry. Linear correlations indicated that nitrate, phosphate and sulfate inhibit tufa growth (p < 0.05). Increased nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations that originate mainly from atmospheric pollution and tourist activities at scenic attractions could trigger excessive diatom growth, which inhibits tufa precipitation. A series of measures should be implemented (e.g., the visitor number and vehicles should be regulated and controlled) to minimize tufa degradation in the Jiuzhaigou National Nature Reserve.																				2073-4441				SEP	2017	9	9							702	10.3390/w9090702	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w9090702													WOS:000411567200075
J	Boronat, L; Miracle, MR; Armengol, X				Boronat, L; Miracle, MR; Armengol, X			Cladoceran assemblages in a mineralization gradient	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Cladoceran assemblages were studied in littoral samples from 44 water bodies in Central Spain, showing great differences in salinity and permanence of water. Principal component analyses (PCA) were performed with data on cladoceran relative abundances to identify the main groups of species. Five main groups of species were found, defining the following types of environments: (I) Small but deep hard water lakes (II) permanent but shallow hard water lakes fed by surface springs, rich in macrophytes (III) ephemeral and shallow soft waters lakes (IV) subsaline and hyposaline lakes in their lower range, specially the permanent ones and (V) saline lakes (salinities >6 mg l(-1)) subject to short or long periods of dryness. The main species constituting these groups were: Group (I): Acroperus neglectus, Alona guttata, Pleuroxus truncatus, Daphnia longispina; group II: Phrixura leei, Latonura rectirostris, Eurycercus lamellatus; Alonella excisa, Daphnia pulicaria; group III: Ephemeroporus phintonicus, Macrothrix rosea, Moina micrura; group IV: Alona rectangula, Ceriodaphnia reticulata, Tetrocephala ambigua, Diaphanosoma mongolianum; group V: Alona salina, Pleuroxus letourneuxi, Dunhevedia crassa, Moina brachiata, Daphnia magna and Daphnia mediterranea. Sample scores from PCA extracted from the correlation matrix of cladoceran proportions were correlated with limnological measurements. Significant correlations with salinity, alkalinity anions and cations indicate that salinity is an important factor in the distribution of the species. However, species assemblages also reflect other factors, such as temporality and littoral development.

J	STEELE, DW; BUTTLE, JM				STEELE, DW; BUTTLE, JM			SULFATE DYNAMICS IN A NORTHERN WETLAND CATCHMENT DURING SNOWMELT	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Fluxes and scores of SO42- were measured in a small Canadian Shield basin during the 1989 snowmelt. Sulphate flux from the unsaturated zone (14.1 +/- 7.3 kg ha(-1)) was four times the amount supplied in meltwater and precipitation (3.5 +/- 0.4 kg ha(-1)). This reflects flushing of soluble SO42- from organic and upper mineral soil horizons during melt, which counteracted potential dilution of groundwater SO42- levels by large water inputs to the basin. 35.6 +/- 12.4 kg SO42- entered the saturated zone during melt, supplied equally by leaching from overlying soils and conversion of the capillary fringe to phreatic water due to rising water table levels. Streamflow conveyed 70% of the total SO42- export of 10.1 +/- 2.3 kg ha(-1), and was largely supplied by groundwater discharge from a wetland in the lower portion of the basin. The remaining 30% of total export was via shallow subsurface flow.

WATER RESEARCH												Data collected from four beaches along southern Lake Michigan (USA) during the summer of 2004 were subjected to correlation and tithe-series regression analyses aimed at identifying an optimal suite of variables that could be used to predict log Escherichia coli concentrations in real time. Although other variables entered into the regression equations, waves, outfalls of bacteria from an adjacent stream, sunshine, temperature, and time of day (morning versus afternoon) turned out to be the most useful and consistent predictive variables. A post-hoc analysis showed that regression models are much more successful than previous day's bacterial concentration at predicting whether or not the beach water quality is above or below the threshold criteria for full body contact established by the USENA. Additional analyses, using 99% confidence intervals on predicted log E coli concentrations, indicated that in extreme cases of high or low health threat, model predictions are likely to be accurate about 90% of the time. The findings of this study are consistent with previous work in the region and seem to indicate that real-time monitoring of hydrometcorological variables can provide the basis of an early warning system for protecting the public from the health risk posed by harmful pathogens in beach water.

Microbial community changes during a toxic cyanobacterial bloom in an alkaline Hungarian lake	ANTONIE VAN LEEUWENHOEK INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GENERAL AND MOLECULAR MICROBIOLOGY												The Carpathian Basin is a lowland plain located mainly in Hungary. Due to the nature of the bedrock, alluvial deposits, and a bowl shape, many lakes and ponds of the area are characterized by high alkalinity. In this study, we characterized temporal changes in eukaryal and bacterial community dynamics with high throughput sequencing and relate the changes to environmental conditions in Lake Velence located in Fejer county, Hungary. The sampled Lake Velence microbial populations (algal and bacterial) were analyzed to identify potential correlations with other community members and environmental parameters at six timepoints over 6weeks in the Spring of 2012. Correlations between community members suggest a positive relationship between certain algal and bacterial populations (e.g. Chlamydomondaceae with Actinobacteria and Acidobacteria), while other correlations allude to changes in these relationships over time. During the study, high nitrogen availability may have favored non-nitrogen fixing cyanobacteria, such as the toxin-producing Microcystis aeruginosa, and the eutrophic effect may have been exacerbated by high phosphorus availability as well as the high calcium and magnesium content of the Carpathian Basin bedrock, potentially fostering exopolymer production and cell aggregation. Cyanobacterial bloom formation could have a negative environmental impact on other community members and potentially affect overall water quality as well as recreational activities. To our knowledge, this is the first prediction for relationships between photoautotrophic eukaryotes and bacteria from an alkaline, Hungarian lake.

Atmospheric methanethiol emitted from a pulp and paper plant on the shore of Lake Baikal	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												On-site measurement of methanethiol (CH3SH) was performed for three years on ships and cars near a pulp and paper plant standing on the shore of Lake Baikal in Siberia, Russia, to investigate the behavior and impact of atmospheric CH3SH emitted from a point source. Despite its strong odor, there are few reports on atmospheric CH3SH, while many investigations have been carried out on dimethyl sulfide (DMS). In this work, CH3SH and DMS were measured every 15 min by a recently developed automated instrument based on single column trapping/separation and chemiluminescence measurement. Hydrogen sulfide, sulfur dioxide and ozone were also measured simultaneously by individual instruments. Of these sulfur compounds, CH3SH was dominant and its concentration sometimes reached several tens of ppbv. The concentration of CH3SH was high at night, because of the lack of photodecomposition and local winds from the mountain to the lake. Such time variation was marked in the summer. The CH3SH level decreased significantly downwind, while decreases in concentrations of other compounds such as DMS and SO2 were relatively small. From these temporal and spatial variations, the behavior of CH3SH is described in this paper. The impact of CH3SH near the Siberian big sources is discussed with the presented data.

More than three-quarters of its inflow comes from the Ili River, which is under increasing strain due to the diversion of water for energy and food production. Commercial fishing in Lake Balkhash began in 1929 and is currently in a state of crisis. The construction of the Balkhash dam and reservoir in the late 1960s reduced Ili River flows into the lake and upset the natural cycle of spring floods, which greatly reduced spawning and feeding areas for carp (Cyprinus carpio). Carp populations were consequently reduced by more than 90% during the filling of the reservoir and have not recovered, even though the lake's level subsequently rose. Catches of carp and freshwater bream (Abramis brama orientalis) have shown an inverse relationship since the 1960s, and the age structure of freshwater bream is changing. Historically, most captured fish of this species were 4- to 7-years-old, but smaller, 3- to 5-year-old fish have dominated recent catches. The total fish harvest from Lake Balkhash is currently at near historical lows, not just because of environmental factors, but also because of structural changes triggered by the collapse of the Soviet Union. Poaching, government disinterest, lack of enforcement of fishing regulations, and the economic challenges faced by today's small fishing enterprises all contribute to the problem.					; Hoshino, Buho/A-1281-2017; Beckmann, Volker/Q-7377-2018; Sharakhmetov, Sayat/JCE-4554-2023	Hoshino, Buho/0000-0002-5909-7869; Thevs, Niels/0000-0003-1923-4280; Beckmann, Volker/0000-0001-6595-7995; Sharakhmetov, Sayat/0000-0001-7278-5351; Pueppke, Steve/0000-0002-5092-1938; Sabir, Nurtazin/0000-0002-4969-6323														2071-1050				APR	2018	10	4							1234	10.3390/su10041234	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su10041234													WOS:000435188000338
J	Overbo, A; Heger, S; Gulliver, J				Overbo, Alycia; Heger, Sara; Gulliver, John			Evaluation of chloride contributions from major point and nonpoint sources in a northern US state	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Chloride pollution of groundwater and surface water resources is an environmental concern in many regions. While use of road salt for winter road maintenance is known to be a major source of chloride in the environment, limited research has investigated the environmental impacts of chloride discharged from water softeners, particularly in areas with hard water. A chloride budget was developed for the state of Minnesota to estimate the amount of chloride discharged from household water softeners as well as other domestic, agricultural, commercial, and industrial sources. The analysis used multiple data sources, including salt sales records and wastewater monitoring data, and used statistical, spatial, and survey methods to estimate chloride loading from major sources statewide. Annual chloride mass contributions were estimated for the following sources: household water softener use; human excretions; household product use; chloride concentrations in drinking water; atmospheric deposition; road salt use; dust suppressant use; fertilizer application; industrial discharge; and livestock excretions. A mass balance for 96 wastewater treatment plants with effluent monitoring data showed that across these facilities, discharge from water softeners was the largest chloride source. A statewide chloride budget found that road salt was the largest source of chloride to the environment, but that WWTP's and fertilizer were also substantial sources, discharging 221,300 t and 209,900 t annually. Water softeners were estimated to contribute 65% of the chloride discharged to all 613 municipal WWTPs statewide. Methods used in this analysis could be applied to other communities, watersheds, or states with similar conditions. The results of the analyses indicate that water softening is an important chloride source in areas with hard water and underscore the importance of identifying and characterizing chloride sources in less urban areas, where deicing salt may be a less important contributor and receiving water bodies are often lakes, reservoirs, and streams.

However, there is still a lack of high-resolution subaqueous geomorphological evidence of how sand mining led to lakebed deformation in the outlet channel. We examined the bed morphology and sub-bottom sedimentary structure of the outlet channel, using a multibeam echo sounder and sub-bottom profiler in Poyang Lake. We found that: (1) the subaqueous micro-topography types of the outlet channel are characterized by sand mining disturbance, natural erosional topography, and flat bed and dunes, accounting for 44.9%, 21.4%, 28.6%, and 5.1% of the channel area, respectively; and (2) sand mining activity affects the local bed topography extensively and significantly. The depth of sandpits caused by sand mining varied from 1.4 m to 12 m deeper than the surrounding bed surface, with 4.41 m of depth increase on average. Hence, the large-scale high-intensity sand mining activities and their significant geomorphic effects demand for an improved assessment for future management and longer-term sustainability. Because of the large-scale and ongoing high-intensity sand mining activities in the Poyang Lake outlet channel, these effects should raise caution in the future and contribute to monitoring efforts that are essential to implement sustainable management solutions. The present study and techniques implemented can serve as a scientific reference for dam construction and sand mining within the Poyang Lake basin.

J	ARAKEL, AV; COHEN, A				ARAKEL, AV; COHEN, A			DEPOSITION AND EARLY DIAGENESIS OF PLAYA GLAUBERITE IN THE KARINGA CREEK DRAINAGE SYSTEM, NORTHERN TERRITORY, AUSTRALIA	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												Glauberite [Na2Ca(SO4)2], in the form of discrete crystals, nodules and lenses, represents the second most common sulphate mineral type (after gypsum) in the chain of modern playa lakes located in the Karinga Creek drainage system, Northern Territory. These modern glauberite deposits exhibit textures and fabrics which reflect both syndeposition with gypsum within the playa phreatic zone, and early diagenetic replacement of host gypsite in the playa vadose zone. Because the distribution of hydrological zones in individual playa lakes vary significantly, the extent of glauberite facies development is highly irregular. Factors controlling glauberite deposition include the nature and extent of groundwater discharge from local and regional aquifers, playa surface evaporation rates, porewater geochemistry and the depth to basal aquicludes. Geochemical and petrographic evidence indicate that the paragenesis of sulphate minerals in the playa lakes of the study area is primarily dictated by the solubility of gypsum, which in turn reflects the extent of dilution and concentration of playa porewaters. On a regional scale, brine dilution and concentration can be related to seasonal and longer-term groundwater recharge-discharge patterns; but, on a local scale, the proximity to springs and ephemeral seepage creeks emanating from local calcrete aquifers is the dominating influence. Hence, a thorough knowledge of groundwater hydrodynamics, particularly the recharge-discharge pattern in playa-marginal areas, must be an essential part of any detailed assessment of the role of depositional and early diagenetic processes in the genesis of glauberite facies in similar arid drainage basins. The close relationship between glauberite facies development and the playa groundwater level has significant implications for interpretations of variation in the water table and other environmental conditions in the shallowing-upwards sequences of ancient lacustrine deposits. The presence of lacustrine glauberite facies may also mark a transition from depositional to early diagenetic evolution of the basinal sulphate mineral facies.																			0037-0738					FEB	1991	70	1					41	59		10.1016/0037-0738(91)90065-L	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0037-0738(91)90065-L													WOS:A1991FD76000003

Satellite microwave remote sensing of North Eurasian inundation dynamics: development of coarse-resolution products and comparison with high-resolution synthetic aperture radar data	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Wetlands are not only primary producers of atmospheric greenhouse gases but also possess unique features that are favourable for application of satellite microwave remote sensing to monitoring their status and trend. In this study we apply combined passive and active microwave remote sensing data sets from the NASA sensors AMSR-E and QuikSCAT to map surface water dynamics over Northern Eurasia. We demonstrate our method on the evolution of large wetland complexes for two consecutive years from January 2006 to December 2007. We apply river discharge measurements from the Ob River along with land surface runoff simulations derived from the Pan-Arctic Water Balance Model during and after snowmelt in 2006 and 2007 to interpret the abundance of widespread flooding along the River Ob in early summer of 2007 observed in the remote sensing products. The coarse-resolution, 25 km, surface water product is compared to a high-resolution, 30 m, inundation map derived from ALOS PALSAR (Advanced Land Observation Satellite phased array L-band synthetic aperture radar) imagery acquired for 11 July 2006, and extending along a transect in the central Western Siberian Plain. We found that the surface water fraction derived from the combined AMSR-E/QuikSCAT data sets closely tracks the inundation mapped using higher-resolution ALOS PALSAR data.

Natural radioactivity levels and associated health hazards from the terrestrial ecosystem in Rosetta branch of the River Nile, Egypt	ISOTOPES IN ENVIRONMENTAL AND HEALTH STUDIES												Twenty soil and 25 sediment samples were collected from the banks and bottom of the River Nile in the surroundings of biggest cities located close to it. Natural radioactivity concentrations of Ra-226, Th-232 and K-40 have been evaluated for all samples by means of spectrometric analysis. The radioactivity levels of soil and sediment samples fall within the internationally recommended values. Nevertheless, high natural background radiation zones are detected in the Kafr El-Zayat region due to the presence of a fertilizer factory, and in the Rosetta region due to the presence of black sand deposits. The absorbed dose rate, the index and excess life time cancer risk are calculated. High values for some of the radiation health parameters are detected in the Kafr El-Zayat and Rosetta regions representing a serious problem to public health because the soil and sediment are used as constructing material for buildings. Furthermore, the isotope analysis of uranium for representative collected sediment samples via spectrometry showed average specific activities of 18.7 +/- 3.6, 0.087 +/- 0.0038 and 18.6 +/- 3.8 Bq kg(-1) for U-234, U-235 and U-238, respectively.

Sediment budget for subalpine watersheds, Lake Tahoe, California, USA	CATENA												Pinpointing erosional 'hot spots' or sediment source areas within a watershed can be difficult because of the highly non-linear and episodic nature of effective runoff and sediment transport. Continuous monitoring of stream networks can provide insight into sediment source areas not possible from routine sampling by capturing episodic events and integrating entire storm events. This paper presents the results of a three-year study of spring snowmelt runoff in watersheds of Lake Tahoe, California, USA, using a network of nine nephelometric turbidometers. We estimate that montane badlands, comprising 1.2% of the Ward Creek watershed (25 km(2)), contributed 10-39% of snowmelt-derived suspended sediment load. The badlands are comprised of poorly-vegetated and deeply-incised gullies formed in parent material of Miocene volcanic mudflow breccia. The larger (29.5 km(2)) Blackwood Creek watershed also showed high relative erosion rates from volcanic terrain. Tributaries draining forested granitic and metasedimentary headwater regions had minimal sediment loads. Monitoring networks indicated that temporary main channel storage regulated release of fine sediment eroded from steep headwater slopes. This lag between erosion and delivery may lead to underestimation of gully erosion contribution to sediment budgets. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The In2O3 aerosol served as an indicator of the amount of AgI aerosol scavenged. Based on the aerosol emission rates, if AgI aerosol was only captured by scavenging processes, and played no part in forming ice crystals and snowfall, the silver to indium ratio (Ag:In) in the analyzed snow, would be 0.8. Analysis of snow samples from the target area produced frequent Ag:In ratio values in excess of 1.1. In the snowfall at the closest sampling sites to the aerosol generators, the high ratios of Ag:In cannot be explained by the contact-freezing ice formation mechanism. A mechanism with a much faster rate than possible by contact freezing is necessary to produce the high Ag:In ratios that were observed. Part of the AgI seeding aerosol functioned rapidly to produce ice crystals by a forced condensation-freezing mechanism immediately after generation, and those ice crystals contributed to the snowfall at those sites closest to the generator.																			0894-8763					NOV	1993	32	11					1726	1732		10.1175/1520-0450(1993)032<1726:AIOTMO>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0450(1993)032<1726:AIOTMO>2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1993MD72700006

Within the ESA-MOST Dragon 4 project, we addressed in particular changes of glaciers and proglacial lakes and their interaction. In addition, we investigated rock glaciers in permafrost environments. Here, we focus on the detailed investigations which have been performed in the Poiqu River Basin, central Himalaya. We used in particular multi-temporal stereo satellite imagery, including high-resolution 1960/70s Corona and Hexagon spy images and contemporary Pleiades data. Sentinel-2 data was applied to assess the glacier flow. The results reveal that glacier mass loss continuously increased with a mass budget of -0.42 +/- 0.11 m w.e.a(-1) for the period 2004-2018. The mass loss has been primarily driven by an increase in summer temperature and is further accelerated by proglacial lakes, which have become abundant. The glacial lake area more than doubled between 1964 and 2017. The termini of glaciers that flow into lakes moved on average twice as fast as glaciers terminating on land, indicating that dynamical thinning plays an important role. Rock glaciers are abundant, covering approximately 21 km(2), which was more than 10% of the glacier area (approximately 190 km(2)) in 2015. With ongoing glacier wastage, rock glaciers can become an increasingly important water resource.					; Bolch, Tobias/ABE-6635-2020; Bolch, Tobias/A-1935-2008; Zhang, Guoqing/N-7388-2019; Liu, Lin/Q-4237-2018; Hu, Yan/AAB-1755-2021; Bhattacharya, Atanu/AAU-9787-2021; Zhang, Guoqing/F-1438-2019	Hu, Yan/0000-0001-8380-276X; Pronk, Jan/0000-0002-2106-9053; Rastner, Philipp/0000-0002-6761-2672; Bolch, Tobias/0000-0002-8201-5059; Liu, Lin/0000-0002-9581-1337; Zhang, Guoqing/0000-0003-2090-2813; King, Owen/0000-0003-1807-9821; Bhattacharya, Atanu/0000-0001-7449-3897														2072-4292				APR	2022	14	8							1927	10.3390/rs14081927	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs14081927													WOS:000787406100001

The accumulation lies at the lateral side of the mountain valley of the Bela River and fills a preglacial palaeovalley of this river. Research combining facies analysis of outcrops, ground penetrating radar survey, interpretation drilling survey, and modelling of the preglacial relief was undertaken at the site. According to the results obtained, the upper part of the sedimentary accumulation represents a coarse-grained terminoglacial glaciofluvial delta of the Gilbert type. The development of the accumulation has dominantly been driven by the preglacial morphology. Facies typical for foresets of coarse-grained deltas represented mainly by high-density flows, cohesionless debris flows, debris falls and less common low-density flows were found in the outcrops. The delta near Pisecna prograded into a lake dammed by the ice-sheet front in the north. The lake was bounded by the slopes of Sokol Ridge, Zlate Hory Highlands and Gory Parkowe on other sides.

Historical occurrence of alien arthropods and pathogens on trees in Canada	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH												The Canadian Forest Invasive Alien Species (CanFIAS) database provides point records of alien arthropod (insects and mites) and pathogen (fungi) species found on trees in Canada extracted from more than 100 years of national surveys. Each record includes a species identification, location, year of observation, and host association and is linked electronically to its original source. More than 175 000 records of 329 alien arthropod species and 11 plant pathogens are available. Historical rates of detection, as indicated by first records, were greatest in the decades following the two world wars. The overall rate has been approximately three species per year since 1900. Richness of alien species is greatest in the Coastal and Great Lakes-St. Lawrence forest ecozones and lowest in the Subalpine and Tundra ecozones. The alien species most significant in terms of extent of invasion and damage to trees are tree-host specialists, feeding on or infecting mostly one or two genera in a single plant family. Important commercial trees including pine, spruce, poplar, and birch and amenity genera including willow, cherry, and maple host the greatest diversity of alien species. Sap-feeding insects are the most speciose feeding group, but foliage-feeding and wood-boring insects and plant pathogens cause the most damage.																			0045-5067	1208-6037				FEB	2016	46	2					172	180		10.1139/cjfr-2015-0273	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfr-2015-0273													WOS:000370049600004

JOURNAL OF EUKARYOTIC MICROBIOLOGY												The globally distributed ciliate Balanion planctonicum is a primary consumer of phytoplankton spring blooms. Due to its small size (similar to 20 mu m), identification and quantification by molecular tools is preferable as an alternative to the laborious counting of specimen in quantitative protargol stains. However, previous sequencing of the 18S rDNA V9 region of B. planctonicum from Lake Zurich (Switzerland) and subsequent quantification by fluorescence in situ hybridization yielded significantly lower cell numbers than using morphotype counting. This raised the question of whether B. planctonicum shows a cryptic diversity or whether it is just a 'complex species' with intra-clonal polymorphisms. Over three years, we established numerous monoclonal cultures, and long-read sequencing of rDNA operons revealed four distinct dominant haplotypes (BpHs 1-4). The gene sequences of BpHs 1 and 3 differed by 6% and did not share intra-clonal polymorphisms, providing evidence for two distinct clades. Furthermore, phylogenetic analyses corroborate the sister relationship between Balanion and Askenasia (plus Hexasterias and Radiosperma). Morphologically, the two Balanion clades are nearly indistinguishable with small differences in macronucleus size and in the cell length to width ratio. CARD-FISH analyses indicated that the diversity of B. planctonicum is even more extensive with still unidentified clades.					; Andrei, Adrian-Stefan/Q-9155-2018	Hofer, Cyrill/0000-0002-1516-7626; Andrei, Adrian-Stefan/0000-0003-1425-7168; Posch, Thomas/0000-0001-5145-3761													1066-5234	1550-7408				JAN	2025	72	1							e13084	10.1111/jeu.13084	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jeu.13084								39868461					WOS:001407190000001

We review the status Of the moth in Great Britain: it has been recorded from the Lake District since 1856 and sporadically from North Wales, but has had several periods of very low abundance when it was suspected of being extinct. The results of a survey in 1990 of Lake District sites for this moth and a survey in 1991 of potential North Wales sites are presented and compared with Lake District surveys in 1955 and 1980/81. Although the moth increased in numbers between 1955 and 1980, the number of sites in which it now occurs has fallen by 56%-to below 1955 levels. The moth is present in one North Wales site. Threats to colonies and management requirements of moth and foodplant are discussed Trial management is being carried out by the National Trust in the Lake District.																			0006-3207						1994	67	1					41	47		10.1016/0006-3207(94)90007-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0006-3207(94)90007-8													WOS:A1994ML47600006

This city represents an ideal situation from a geochemical point of view (outcropping rocks are enriched rocks in terms of heavy metals content) where anthropic emissions are exclusively associated to traffic and heating systems. The impact of biological activity and soil erosion on sedimentation process were investigated in one urban lake, where the sedimentation model was defined using radiometric determinations (Cs-137 and unsupported Pb-210). Fluxes calculations and isotopic composition of lead were performed in order to enhance the metal distribution through the collected core. Statistical analysis allowed discriminating elements in two main groups: traffic related metals and urban aero-disperse elements. Indexes, which can estimate the elemental affinity to the urban dust, were calculated for metal source definition. Lake sediments recorded the fall of Pb air content that occurred after leaded gasoline phasing out and after about 10 years the total amount of Pb decreased of about 90%.

Its use is expected to increase in the near future, which brings attention to the impacts of discharging thermally altered water into aquatic systems. Our review indicates that thermal discharge affects physical and ecological processes, with impacts recorded at all levels of biological organization. Many in situ studies found local effects of thermal discharge (such as attraction or avoidance of mobile organisms), while impacts at the scale of the whole water body were rarely detected. In complex systems, diffuse impacts of thermal discharge are difficult to disentangle from natural variability or other anthropogenic influences. Discharge of warm water in summer is likely to be most critical, especially in the context of climate change. Under this scenario, water temperatures may reach maxima that negatively affect some species. Given the diversity and complexity of the impacts of thermal pollution on aquatic systems, careful planning and judicious management is required when using lakes and rivers for extraction and disposal of heat. We discuss the drivers that influence the severity of potential impacts of such thermal use, and the options available to avoid or mitigate these impacts (such as adapting the operating conditions).

Its ultimate goal is to probe liquid-water pockets below the ice surface of Enceladus for signatures of life. A probe could be based on the IceMole concept, which melts curved trajectories through the ice. In the Enceladus Explorer project, a specialized IceMole probe for a terrestrial test scenario is in development. The goal of this exploratory study is to probe water from a liquid crevasse close to Blood Falls at Taylor Glacier, Antarctica. To navigate such a probe it is essential to be able to determine its position and monitor its trajectory. Part of the navigation system is the in-ice acoustic positioning system. For this, the head of the IceMole is equipped with acoustic sensors, which receive signals from synchronized acoustic emitters situated at the ice surface. Based on the measured propagation times, the speed of sound in ice and the positions of the emitters at the surface, the position of the IceMole can be determined by trilateration techniques. Here we present the developed acoustic positioning system, which is designed to track the in-ice melting probe up to distances of 100 m in glacier ice. Results from full-system tests in water and a first field test on Morteratschgletscher, Switzerland, are discussed.

Avian paramyxovirus 4 isolated from the mallard (Anas platyrhynchos, Linnaeus, 1758): the first case detected in the Western Caspian region	SOUTH OF RUSSIA-ECOLOGY DEVELOPMENT												Aim. The work is aimed at exploring the molecular and genetic properties of avian paramyxovirus 4 (APMV-4) isolated from the mallard duck. Material and Methods. In 2018, as a part of an influenza A virus surveillance programme, biological samples were collected from wild birds on Lake Adzhi (Papas) in the Republic of Dagestan. The isolation of virus strains from biological samples was performed using 10-day-old special pathogen free chicken eggs. The primary detection of hemagglutinating agents in the fluid of the allantoic cavity was carried out via hemagglutination assay. The presence of RNA of the influenza A virus was determined using Real Time PCR. Then, for samples negative in PCR for the influenza A virus, the complete genome DNA sequences were established using NGS sequencing. It was determined that the APMV-4 strain obtained belonged to intraspecific genetic lines was determined using phylogenetic analysis. Results. APMV 4 strain was isolated for the first time in the Western Caspian region. Phylogenetic analysis of the complete genome and gene F showed that the APMV-4/mallard/Dagestan/52d/2018 strain belongs to the Eurasian Glade of subgenotypes. Analysis of amino add substitutions showed that the cleavage site of the fusion protein is monobasic which is characteristic of lentogenic strains. Conclusion. During the surveillance program for influenza A viruses in autumn 2018, the APMV 4 strain was isolated from the mallard duck. Analysis revealed that the APMV-4 strain was closely phylogenetically related to strains isolated from two wild and one domestic duck from China. This suggests an interconnection between the bird populations in China and the Western Caspian region within the West Asian-East African migration route.

J	Waiser, MJ; Robarts, RD				Waiser, MJ; Robarts, RD			Impacts of a herbicide and fertilizers on the microbial community of a saline prairie lake	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Prairie wetlands are scattered among cultivated land where herbicides and fertilizers are regularly used. Avadex-BW(C) (active ingredient triallate) is one of the most popular pre-emergent herbicides used on the Canadian prairies to control wild oats and other broadleaf weeds. Triallate enters aquatic systems through processes of runoff and direct overspray, while fertilizers (nitrogen and phosphorus) enter through runoff and aeolian deposition. Microcosm studies on Redberry Lake, an oligotrophic prairie lake, indicated that additions of triallate stimulated bacterial production ([H-3]thymidine incorporation), metabolism ([C-14]glucose uptake), and numbers, but only if nitrogen and phosphorus were added. Because the microbial community is nutrient limited, there is the possibility that triallate could bioaccumulate in this system. Addition of nitrogen and phosphorus (N + P) stimulated measures of phytoplankton biomass (Chl a), bacterial metabolism, numbers, and production. Although triallate had little effect on bacteria, at any concentration tested, substantial declines in phytoplankton biomass occurred at triallate concentrations greater than or equal to 1000 mu g.L-1. Greatest impacts of herbicides and nutrients, however, are expected in spring as a result of runoff events, aeolian deposition, and direct overspray.																			0706-652X					FEB	1997	54	2					320	329		10.1139/cjfas-54-2-320	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-54-2-320													WOS:A1997XB78700009

M.; Jakobsen, Rasmus			Hydrogen thresholds and steady-state concentrations associated with microbial arsenate respiration	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												H-2 thresholds for microbial respiration of arsenate (As(V)) were investigated in a pure culture of Sulfurospirillum arsenophilum. H-2 was consumed to threshold concentrations of 0.03-0.09 nmol/L with As(V) as terminal electron acceptor, allowing for a Gibbs free-energy yield of 36-41 kJ per mol of reaction. These thresholds are among the lowest measured for anaerobic respirers and fall into the range of denitrifiers or Fe(III)-reducers. In sediments from an arsenic-contaminated aquifer in the Red River flood plain, Vietnam, H-2 levels decreased to 0.4-2 nmol/L when As(V) was added under anoxic conditions. When As(V) was depleted, H-2 concentrations rebounded by a factor of 10, a level similar to that observed in arsenic-free controls. The sediment-associated microbial population completely reduced millimolar levels of As(V) to arsenite (As(III)) within a few days. The rate of As(V)-reduction was essentially the same in sediments amended with a pure culture of S. arsenophilum. These findings together with a review of observed H-2 threshold and steady-state values suggest that microbial As(V)-respirers have a competitive advantage over several other anaerobic respirers through their ability to thrive at low H-2 levels.

A population of dwarf common carp (Cyprinus carpio carpio morpha hungaricus) forms an isolated, self-sustaining community in the lake, adapted to extreme thermal and chemical conditions. During continuous research conducted since 2007, we identified a hermaphroditic individual for the first-time following sampling during the winter period in 2024. Macroscopic examination revealed testicular tissue distinguishable from ovarian tissue. Histological analysis indicated that the small-bodied fish were in a pre-spawning phase, with gonads displaying traits of simultaneous hermaphroditism. In addition was capable of producing mature eggs and sperm concurrently. According to both literature and our experimental findings, this individual may have been capable of self-fertilization. Further investigation is required to ascertain whether specific or combined suboptimal environmental factors and/or endocrine-disrupting chemicals contributed to the emergence of hermaphroditism in this individual.

Quantitative target and systematic non-target analysis of polar organic micro-pollutants along the river Rhine using high-resolution mass-spectrometry - Identification of unknown sources and compounds	WATER RESEARCH												In this study, the contamination by polar organic pollutants was investigated along the Rhine River, an important source of drinking water for 22 million people in central Europe. Following the flow of the river, a traveling water mass was sampled using weekly flow-proportional composite samples at ten different downstream sites, including main tributaries. Using a broad analytical method based on solid phase extraction and high-resolution mass spectrometry, the water was analyzed for more than 300 target substances. While the water in Lake Constance contained only 83 substances in often low concentrations, the number of detects found in the water phase increased to 143 substances and a weekly load of more than 7 tons at the last sampling site, the Dutch-German border. Mostly present were chemicals originating from wastewater treatment plants, especially the artificial sweetener Acesulfam and two pharmaceuticals, Metformin and Gabapentin, which dominate the weekly load up to 58%. Although the sample campaign was performed in a dry period in early spring, a large variety of pesticides and biocides were detected. Several industrial point sources were identified along the waterway's 900 km journey, resulting in high concentrations in the tributaries and loads of up to 160 kg. Additionally, an unbiased non-target analysis was performed following two different strategies for the prioritization of hundreds of potentially relevant unknown masses. While for the first prioritization strategy, only chlorinated compounds were extracted from the mass spectrometer datasets, the second prioritization strategy was performed using a systematic reduction approach between the different sampling sites. Among others, two substances that never had been detected before in this river, namely, the muscle relaxant Tizanidine and the solvent 1,3-Dimethyl-2-imidazolidinone (DMI), were identified and confirmed, and their loads were roughly estimated along the river.

J	KALFF, J; WATSON				KALFF, J; WATSON			PHYTOPLANKTON AND ITS DYNAMICS IN 2 TROPICAL LAKES - A TROPICAL AND TEMPERATE ZONE COMPARISON	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Temporal patterns of phytoplankton biomass and community structure are described for two Kenyan lakes and subsequently compared with patterns reported in other tropical and temperate lakes. Lake Naivasha had a lower and more seasonally variable (10x) biomass, with a seasonal shift between diatoms and blue-greens, while the L. Oloidien biomass was less variable (3.7x) and dominated by blue-greens. Biomass and chlorophyll .alpha. were strongly correlated and in turn were coupled to the level of total phosphorus. A total of 143 and 94 taxa were described for L. Naivasha and L. Oloidien, respectively. The comparative analysis showed: a) a paucity of exclusively tropical species; b) that more than 30 percent of the species in two highly saline Kenyan lakes were also present in the two freshwater lakes; c) no evidence for a postulated decline of phytoplankton species abundance with latitude from the temperate zone to the tropics; d) that the low fraction of chrysophyte biomass in tropical lakes is a function of trophy rather than of latitude; e) that the fraction of chlorophyte biomass in tropical lakes is generally higher than in temperate lakes; f) that the proportion of nannoplankton in the two Kenyan freshwater lakes is not different from that in temperate lakes of the same trophy; g) that seasonal or annual biomass oscillations in the tropics are not systematically lower than in the temperate zone; h) evidence for large inter-year difference in the max.:min. biomass ratio in the only tropical lake (L. Naivasha) for which such data are available; i) that an average biomass ratio appears predictable for tropical lakes from the proportion of the sediment surface in contact with epilimnetic water.

J	Graham, MD; Vinebrooke, RD				Graham, Mark D.; Vinebrooke, Rolf D.			Extreme weather events alter planktonic communities in boreal lakes	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Climate warming has been shown to increase the frequency of extreme weather effects on small lakes by increasing the variability of terrigenic inputs and surface water temperatures. We hypothesized that the effect of thermal variability on boreal plankton depends on dissolved terrigenic matter (i.e., temperature-terrigenic interaction). A two-factor mesocosm (1500-L capacity) experiment consisting of three terrigenic treatment levels (control, [-] runoff, [+] runoff) and three temperature treatment levels (control, warm, and cold) was conducted in triplicate for a total of 27 mesocosms deployed in Lake 302S of the Experimental Lakes Area in Canada. The warming treatment amplified the positive effect of terrigenic amendment on total phytoplankton biomass by stimulating large (>35-mu m Greatest Axial Linear Dimension; GALD) taxa during the 50-d experiment. In comparison, removal of terrigenic matter increased the abundance of smaller (<35-mu m GALD) phytoplankton along with copepods and cladocerans under cold and warm conditions, respectively. We also attempted to corroborate our experimental findings by comparing planktonic communities collected from reference Lake 239 during climatically contrasting summers between 1970 and 2001. Although planktonic communities in Lake 239 also differed significantly between years characterized by cold, wet vs. warm, dry ice-free conditions, their responses ran opposite to those detected during the experiment, highlighting the potential overriding importance of other scale-dependent factors (e.g., fish predation, vertical migration) mediating the effects of climate on lake communities.

J	Staehr, PA; Baastrup-Spohr, L; Sand-Jensen, K; Stedmon, C				Staehr, Peter A.; Baastrup-Spohr, Lars; Sand-Jensen, Kaj; Stedmon, Colin			Lake metabolism scales with lake morphometry and catchment conditions	AQUATIC SCIENCES												We used a comparative data set for 25 lakes in Denmark sampled during summer to explore the influence of lake morphometry, catchment conditions, light availability and nutrient input on lake metabolism. We found that (1) gross primary production (GPP) and community respiration (R) decline with lake area, water depth and drainage ratio, and increase with algal biomass (Chl), dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total phosphorus (TP); (2) all lakes, especially small with less incident light, and forest lakes with high DOC, have negative net ecosystem production (NEP < 0); (3) daily variability of GPP decreases with lake area and water depth as a consequence of lower input of nutrients and organic matter per unit water volume; (4) the influence of benthic processes on free water metabolic measures declines with increasing lake size; and (5) with increasing lake size, lake metabolism decreases significantly per unit water volume, while depth integrated areal rates remain more constant due to a combination of increased light and nutrient limitation. Overall, these meta-parameters have as many significant but usually weaker relationships to whole-lake and benthic metabolism as have TP, Chl and DOC that are directly linked to photosynthesis and respiration. Combining water depth and Chl to predict GPP, and water depth and DOC to predict R, lead to stronger multiple regression models accounting for 57-63% of the variability of metabolism among the 25 lakes. It is therefore important to consider differences in lake morphometry and catchment conditions when comparing metabolic responses of lakes to human impacts.

In this study, we analyzed a - 4.8-m aeolian loess-sand sequence from the Yarlung Tsangpo Valley in the southern TP. A closely spaced sampling strategy was used for optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating. With single-aliquot regenerative-dose (SAR) OSL and postinfrared (post-IR) OSL protocols, the medium-grained (38-63 & mu;m) quartz fraction was selected to establish a detailed chronology. The two most popular OSL readers (Lexsyg and Riso) were applied to all samples for equivalent dose measurement, and the corresponding comparison shows very good reproducibility of ages derived from the two independent reader systems. A total of 23 luminescence ages were obtained ranging from 6.7 & PLUSMN; 0.3 ka to 11.6 & PLUSMN; 0.7 ka in stratigraphical order. Aeolian sands accumulated during cold-dry Younger Dryas period, and the overlying loess deposited during Early Holocene. Frequency-dependent susceptibility is used to infer pedogenesis intensity or vegetation cover, and coarse grain size fraction is used to reflect the dust activity frequency during Early Holocene. The reconstructed variation of dust activity frequency in the southern TP shows strong cyclicity of - 1 ka, - 0.7 ka and - 0.5 ka with confidence level of >95%, probably indicating that the regional dust activities on centennial and millennium scales are closely related to the changes of the NorthAtlantic Oscillation (NAO) phase as response to solar irradiance forcing.

Fingerprinting of glacial silt in lake sediments yields continuous records of alpine glaciation (35-15ka), western USA	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												Fingerprinting glacial silt in last glacial-age sediments from Upper Klamath Lake (UKL) and Bear Lake (BL) provides continuous radiocarbon-dated records of glaciation for the southeastern Cascade Range and northwestern Uinta Mountains. respectively. Comparing of these records to cosmogenic exposure ages from moraines suggests that variations in glacial flour largely reflect glacial extent. The two areas are at similar latitudes and yield similar records of glacial growth and recession, even though UKL lies less than 200 km from the ocean and BL is in the continental interior. As sea level began to fall prior to the global Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), existing glaciers in the UKL area expanded. Near the beginning of the global LGM (26.5 ka), the BL record indicates onset of glaciation and UKL-area glaciers underwent further expansion. Both records indicate that local glaciers reached their maximum extents near the end of the global LGM, remained near their maxima for -1000 yr, and underwent two stages of retreat separated by a short period of expansion.

Malaria Vectors in Lake Victoria and Adjacent Habitats in Western Kenya	PLOS ONE												The prevalence of malaria among the residents of the Lake Victoria basin remains high. The environment associated with the lake may maintain a high number of malaria vectors. Lake habitats including water hyacinths have been suspected to be the source of vectors. This study investigated whether malaria vectors breed in the lake habitats and adjacent backwater pools. Anopheline larvae were collected within the littoral zone of the lake and adjacent pools located along approximately 24.3 km of the lakeshore in western Kenya, and their breeding sites characterized. Three primary vector species, Anopheles arabiensis, Anopheles gambiae s.s. and Anopheles funestus s.s., and three potential vectors, were found in the lake habitats. Unexpectedly, An. arabiensis was the most dominant vector species in the lake sampling sites. Its habitats were uncovered or covered with short grass. A potential secondary malaria vector, Anopheles rivulorum, dominated the water hyacinths in the lake. Most breeding sites in the lake were limited to areas that were surrounded by tall emergent plants, including trees, and those not exposed to waves. Nearly half of adjacent habitats were lagoons that were separated from the lake by sand bars. Lagoons contained a variety of microhabitats. Anopheles arabiensis dominated open habitats, whereas An. funestus s.s. was found mainly in vegetated habitats in lagoons. The current study confirmed that several breeding sites are associated with Lake Victoria. Given that Lake Victoria is the second largest lake in the world, the lake related habitats must be extensive; therefore, making targeted vector control difficult. Further exploration is necessary to estimate the effects of lake associated habitats on malaria transmission so as to inform a rational decision-making process for vector control.

Climatic and human influences on fire regimes in mixed conifer forests in Yosemite National Park, USA	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												The goal of this study was to identify the influence of interannual and interdecadal climate variation and changes in land use on fire regimes in fire prone mixed conifer forests in the central Sierra Nevada in Yosemite National Park, California. We quantified fire frequency, fire return interval, fire extent, and season of fire for a 400 year period using fire-scar dendrochronology. The influence of regional climate variability and land use on fire occurrence and extent was assessed by relating the fire record to regional climate reconstructions and to documentary records of settlement and land use. The timing and extent for fires was related to interannual and interdecadal variation in drought and temperature linked to variation in the Pacific North America Pattern (PNA), the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and El Nino-Southern Oscillation (NINO) had little effect on fire. The occurrence of large fires was also influenced by interactions among climate patterns and they occurred more often than expected in PNA(+) NINO3- years. At interdecadal time scales area burned was positively correlated with temperature and the PNA. Fire occurrence and extent declined with mid-19th century Euro-American settlement and land use change and fire was nearly eliminated after 1900 when a fire exclusion policy was implemented. A two-fold increase in rate of burning in the late 18th and early 19th century corresponds with spread of non-native disease to Native American populations during the Spanish Colonial Period but the PNA was also mainly positive during this period. Fire regimes were sensitive to shifting modes of climate and land use which can lead to variable pathways of forest development and hence forest structure. Forest structure at the time of Euro-American settlement reflects this sensitivity and managers should consider presettlement conditions as only a guide for restoration planning in forests highly altered by fire exclusion under a changing climate. Moreover, considering winter PNA could provide managers with an early indication of conditions during the fire season that are conducive to widespread fire. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

J	Alagbe, SA				Alagbe, S. A.			Preliminary evaluation of hydrochemistry of the Kalambaina Formation, Sokoto Basin, Nigeria	ENVIRONMENTAL GEOLOGY												Hydrochemical investigations in the Kalambaina Formation have been initiated to determine potability and suitability of the shallow groundwater for domestic and agricultural uses. This limestone formation is an extensive aquifer supplying water to livestock and domestic wells in its outcrop areas. The aquifer is recharged by rainfall and discharges mainly into the Sokoto-Rima River system and lakes at Kware, Gwadabawa and Kalmalo in Nigeria. Because recharge to the aquifer is mainly from rainfall, the quality of the groundwater is controlled essentially by chemical processes in the vadose zone and locally by human activities. Water samples were taken at 11 sites comprising boreholes, dug wells and a spring and were chemically analysed for their major ion components. Hydrochemical results show water of fairly good quality. It is, however, hard and generally of moderate dissolved solids content. Concentration of the total dissolved solids is between 130 and 2,340 mg/l. Concentrations of ions vary widely but a high concentration of K+ is found in places. NO3- is on the higher side of the World Health Organization (WHO) permissible limits, indicating pollution in such areas. Groundwater chemistry is predominantly of two facies, namely the calcium-magnesium-bicarbonate and calcium-magnesium-sulphate-chloride facies. These facies probably evolved primarily as a result of dissolution of calcium and magnesium carbonates as well as some human/land-use activities.																			0943-0105					OCT	2006	51	1					39	45		10.1007/s00254-006-0302-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00254-006-0302-5													WOS:000240515300004

Here we ask how low supply of dietary carbon affects somatic growth, reproduction, and survival of Daphnia magna and test effects of higher water temperature (+3 degrees C relative to ambient) and brown-ification (3X higher than natural water color; both predicted effects of climate change) during fall cooling. We predicted that even at very low carbon supply (similar to 5 mu g CL-1), higher water temperature and brownification will allow D. magna to increase its fitness. Neonates (<24 h old) were incubated with lake seston for 4 weeks (October-November 2013) in experimental bottles submerged in outdoor mesocosms to explore effects of warmer and darker water. Higher temperature and brownification did not significantly affect food quality, as assessed by its fatty acid composition. Daphnia exposed to both increased temperature and brownification had highest somatic growth and were the only that reproduced, and higher temperature caused the highest Daphnia survival success. These results suggest that even under low temperature and thus lower physiological activity, low food quantity is more important than its quality for D. magna fitness.					; Kainz, Martin/AAG-6268-2021	Kainz, Martin/0000-0002-2388-1504; Rasconi, Serena/0000-0001-6667-8904; 													1129-5767	1723-8633					2017	76	1					161	169		10.4081/jlimnol.2016.1450	http://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jlimnol.2016.1450													WOS:000396708700015

Cumulative geoecological effects of 62 years of infrastructure and climate change in ice-rich permafrost landscapes, Prudhoe Bay Oilfield, Alaska	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Many areas of the Arctic are simultaneously affected by rapid climate change and rapid industrial development. These areas are likely to increase in number and size as sea ice melts and abundant Arctic natural resources become more accessible. Documenting the changes that have already occurred is essential to inform management approaches to minimize the impacts of future activities. Here, we determine the cumulative geoecological effects of 62years (1949-2011) of infrastructure- and climate-related changes in the Prudhoe Bay Oilfield, the oldest and most extensive industrial complex in the Arctic, and an area with extensive ice-rich permafrost that is extraordinarily sensitive to climate change. We demonstrate that thermokarst has recently affected broad areas of the entire region, and that a sudden increase in the area affected began shortly after 1990 corresponding to a rapid rise in regional summer air temperatures and related permafrost temperatures. We also present a conceptual model that describes how infrastructure-related factors, including road dust and roadside flooding are contributing to more extensive thermokarst in areas adjacent to roads and gravel pads. We mapped the historical infrastructure changes for the Alaska North Slope oilfields for 10 dates from the initial oil discovery in 1968-2011. By 2010, over 34% of the intensively mapped area was affected by oil development. In addition, between 1990 and 2001, coincident with strong atmospheric warming during the 1990s, 19% of the remaining natural landscapes (excluding areas covered by infrastructure, lakes and river floodplains) exhibited expansion of thermokarst features resulting in more abundant small ponds, greater microrelief, more active lakeshore erosion and increased landscape and habitat heterogeneity. This transition to a new geoecological regime will have impacts to wildlife habitat, local residents and industry.

Consequently, ecological studies relying on modern observations or historical records may have difficulty assessing natural vegetation dynamics under current and future climate. We combined a sedimentary pollen record from Lago di Massacciucoli, Tuscany, Italy with simulations from the LandClim dynamic vegetation model to determine what vegetation preceded intense human disturbance, how past changes in vegetation relate to fire and browsing, and the potential of an extinct vegetation type under present climate. We simulated vegetation dynamics near Lago di Massaciucoli for the last 7,000 years using a local chironomid-inferred temperature reconstruction with combinations of three fire regimes (small infrequent, large infrequent, small frequent) and three browsing intensities (no browsing, light browsing, and moderate browsing), and compared model output to pollen data. Simulations with low disturbance support pollen-inferred evidence for a mixed forest dominated by Quercus ilex (a Mediterranean species) and Abies alba (a montane species). Whereas pollen data record the collapse of A. alba after 6000 cal yr bp, simulated populations expanded with declining summer temperatures during the late Holocene. Simulations with increased fire and browsing are consistent with evidence for expansion by deciduous species after A. alba collapsed. According to our combined paleo-environmental and modeling evidence, mixed Q. ilex and A. alba forests remain possible with current climate and limited disturbance, and provide a viable management objective for ecosystems near the Mediterranean coast and in regions that are expected to experience a mediterranean-type climate in the future.

The lakes are characterized by low ionic strength, clear waters, and oligotrophic conditions; are fed predominantly by atmospheric precipitation; and are ice-covered during a large part of the year. Lead- and copper-complexing ligands were determined by cathodic stripping voltammetry with ligand competition using Calcein blue and salicylaldoxime, respectively. Water column averages of the dissolved lead concentrations ranged from 0.2 to 0.9 nmol L-1, with generally lowest levels during the prolonged winter ice cover, whereas dissolved copper concentrations, varying from 1 to 1.7 (+/- 0.1) nmol L-1, showed no significant seasonal variations. The lead speciation was controlled by complexation with ligands at concentrations mostly below 2 nmol L-1, with values for the stability constant (log K'(PbL)) of 12.5-13.7; calculated ionic lead concentrations (-log[Pb2+] values) were 11.9-14.5. Copper complexation was controlled by ligands at concentrations of 12-21 nmol L-1, with values for log K'(CuL) of 13.5-14.0 and -log[Cu2+] values of 14.4-15.1. The concentration of the copper-binding ligands, but not those for lead, varied seasonally, with about 50% higher concentrations during open water conditions compared to periods of ice cover. The data were consistent with the presence of only one class of ligands for copper and lead. The stability constant of the ligands is similar to that of fulvic acid; however, evidence regarding the actual nature of the ligands is still lacking. The lake data show that (1) competition between calcium and lead causes a reduction in the stability constant of approximately one log-unit for each order of magnitude of Ca2+, and (2) lead scavenging in the lakes is moderated by complexation.

Compared to the pelagic zones, the littoral zones were overall characterised by higher macrophyte dominance and lower concentrations of total phosphorus and alkalinity and higher concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and humic substances. Similarities of bacterial production and biomass turnover and density of active phylotypes and morphotype proportions were related to similarities in a set of environmental variables (including nutrients, humic substances content, predator density and phytoplankton biomass), and some additionally to lake area. Horizontal heterogeneity in bacterioplankton variables (littoral versus pelagic) increased with lake area. Bacterioplankton biomass and production tended to be lower in the littoral zone than in the pelagic zone despite higher concentrations of DOC and humic substances. A likely explanation is higher predation on bacterioplankton in the littoral zone, although allelophatic effects exerted by macrophytes cannot be excluded. Our results indicate that organic cycling via bacterioplankton may be less efficient in the littoral zone than in the pelagic zone of shallow lakes.

J	Yang, K; Wu, H; Qin, J; Lin, CG; Tang, WJ; Chen, YY				Yang, Kun; Wu, Hui; Qin, Jun; Lin, Changgui; Tang, Wenjun; Chen, Yingying			Recent climate changes over the Tibetan Plateau and their impacts on energy and water cycle: A review	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												The Tibetan Plateau (TP) exerts strong thermal forcing on the atmosphere over Asian monsoon region and supplies water resources to adjacent river basins. Recently, the Plateau experienced evident climate changes, which have changed atmospheric and hydrological cycles and thus reshaped the local environment. This study reviewed recent research progress in the climate changes and explored their impacts on the Plateau energy and water cycle, based on which a conceptual model to synthesize these changes was proposed and urgent issues to be explored were summarized. The TP has experienced an overall surface air warming and moistening, solar dimming, and wind stilling since the beginning of the 1980s. The surface warming depends on elevation and its horizontal pattern is consistent with the one of the glacier change. Accompanying the warming was air moistening, and both facilitated the trigger of more deep-clouds, which resulted in solar dimming. Surface wind speed declined from the 1970s, as a result of atmospheric circulation adjustment caused by the differential surface warming between the Asian highlatitude and low-latitude. The climate changes had weakened the thermal forcing over the TP. The warming and wind stilling lowered the Bowen ratio and led to less surface sensible heating. Atmospheric radiative cooling was enhanced, mainly by outgoing longwave emission from the warming planetary system and slightly by solar radiation reflection. Both processes contributed to the thermal forcing weakening over the Plateau. The water cycle was also altered by the climate changes. The wind stilling may have weakened water vapor exchange between the Asia monsoon region and the Plateau and thus led to less precipitation in the monsoon-impacted southern and eastern Plateau, but the warming enhanced land evaporation. Their overlap resulted in runoff reduction in the southern and eastern Plateau regions. By contrast, more convective precipitation over the central TP was triggered under the warmer and moister condition and yielded more runoff; meanwhile, the solar dimming weakened lake evaporation. The two together with enhanced glacier melts contributed to the lake expansion in the central TP. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Metagenomic and whole-genome analysis reveals new lineages of gokushoviruses and biogeographic separation in the sea	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												Much remains to be learned about single-stranded (ss) DNA viruses in natural systems, and the evolutionary relationships among them. One of the eight recognized families of ssDNA viruses is the Microviridae, a group of viruses infecting bacteria. In this study we used metagenomic analysis, genome assembly, and amplicon sequencing of purified ssDNA to show that bacteriophages belonging to the subfamily Gokushovirinae within the Microviridae are genetically diverse and widespread members of marine microbial communities. Metagenomic analysis of coastal samples from the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) and British Columbia, Canada, revealed numerous sequences belonging to gokushoviruses and allowed the assembly of five putative genomes with an organization similar to chlamydiamicroviruses. Fragment recruitment to these genomes from different metagenomic data sets is consistent with gokushovirus genotypes being restricted to specific oceanic regions. Conservation among the assembled genomes allowed the design of degenerate primers that target an 800 bp fragment from the gene encoding the major capsid protein. Sequences could be amplified from coastal temperate and subtropical waters, but not from samples collected from the Arctic Ocean, or freshwater lakes. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that most sequences were distantly related to those from cultured representatives.

Our results greatly expand the known sequence space for gokushoviruses, and reveal biogeographic separation and new evolutionary lineages of gokushoviruses in the oceans.					suttle, c/N-1144-2019; Labonte, Jessica/AHC-5426-2022	Labonte, Jessica/0000-0003-0236-7634; 													1664-302X					DEC 24	2013	4								404	10.3389/fmicb.2013.00404	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2013.00404								24399999					WOS:000331557300002
J	Fang, X; Stefan, HG				Fang, X; Stefan, HG			Projections of climate change effects on water temperature characteristics of small lakes in the contiguous US	CLIMATIC CHANGE												To simulate effects of projected climate change on water temperature characteristics of small lakes in the contiguous U.S., a deterministic, one-dimensional year-round water temperature model is applied. In cold regions the model simulates ice and snow cover on a lake. The lake parameters required as model input are surface area, maximum depth, and Secchi depth as a measure of radiation attenuation and trophic state. The model is driven by daily weather data. Weather records from 209 stations in the contiguous U.S. for the period 1961-1979 were used to represent present climate conditions. The projected climate change owing to a doubling of atmospheric CO2 was obtained from the output of the Canadian Climate Center General Circulation Model. The simulated water temperature and ice characteristics are related to the geometric and trophic state lake characteristics and to geographic location. By interpolation, the sensitivity of lake water temperature characteristics to latitude, longitude, lake geometry and trophic status can therefore be quantified for small lakes in the contiguous U.S. The 2 x CO2 climate scenario is projected to increase maximum and minimum lake surface temperatures by up to 5.2 degrees C. (Maximum surface water temperatures in lakes near the northern and the southern border of the contiguous U.S. currently differ by up to 13 degrees C.) Maximum temperature differences between lake surface and lake bottom are projected to increase in average by only 1 to 2 degrees C after climate warming. The duration of seasonal summer stratification is projected to be up to 66 days longer under a 2 x CO2 climate scenario. Water temperatures of less than 8 degrees C are projected to occur on lake bottoms during a period which is on the order of 50 days shorter under a 2 x CO2 climate scenario. With water temperature change projected to be as high as 5.2 degrees C, ecological impacts such as shifts in species distributions and in fish habitat are most likely. Ice covers on lakes of northern regions would also be changed strongly.																			0165-0009	1573-1480				JUN	1999	42	2					377	412		10.1023/A:1005431523281	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1005431523281													WOS:000081003600002
J	ELROD, JH; SCHNEIDER, CP				ELROD, JH; SCHNEIDER, CP			SEASONAL BATHYTHERMAL DISTRIBUTION OF JUVENILE LAKE TROUT IN LAKE-ONTARIO	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Bathythermal distributions of hatchery-reared lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) of three genetic strains (Lake Superior; Clearwater Lake, Manitoba; and Seneca Lake, New York) were described from catches with bottom trawls in Lake Ontario during April-May, June, July-August, and October, 1978-1984. This work was part of a program to evaluate post-stocking performance of hatchery-reared fish and identify strains for continues use in rehabilitation of lake trout in Lake Ontario. All age groups of Lake Superior fish were in deeper water in April-May than in June each year; mean depth of capture was greatest at age II and became progressively shallower at ages III and IV. Mean depth of capture in April-May was positively correlated with severity of the preceding winter as judged by heating degree days and average wind speed. During July-August, the fish were concentrated between the epilimnion and 50 m, with no consistent trend in depth by age; however, 92% were captured at water temperatures of 12.degree. C or lower. Mean temperatures of capture for Lake Superior fish during the four respective sampling periods were 3.9, 7.5, 6.9, and 9.5.degree. C for fish of age II and 3.9, 8.4, 6.9, and 8.7.degree. C for fish of age III. The age-II Clearwater Lake fish were consistently at shallower depths than age-II Lake Superior fish. Mean temperatures of capture were 4.2 9.7, 9.6, and 10.7.degree. C during the four respective sampling periods; during July-August, 91% were taken in water of 12.degree. C or lower. The distribution of Seneca Lake fish was similar to that of the Lake Superior strain. Mean temperatures at which the three strains were captured were well below published preferred temperatures of yearlings in the laboratory. Annual variations in depth distributions during a given season were probably due to differing thermal regimes resulting from annual variations in the weather.																			0380-1330						1987	13	2					121	134		10.1016/S0380-1330(87)71636-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(87)71636-0													WOS:A1987J558000003

Lidar investigation of wind turbulence on the coastal zone of Lake Baikal at presence of a low-level jet in the atmosphere	24TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEAN OPTICS: ATMOSPHERIC PHYSICS	Proceedings of SPIE				24th International Symposium on Atmospheric and Ocean Optics - Atmospheric Physics	JUL 02-05, 2018	Tomsk, RUSSIA	Russian Acad Sci, Siberian Branch, V E Zuev Inst Atmospher Opt, Russian Acad Sci, Siberian Branch, Inst Solar Terrestrial Phys, Russian Fdn Basic Res, Russian Acad Sci, Siberian Branch				To study the peculiarities of wind turbulence in the presence of a low-level jet (LLJ) in the atmospheric boundary layer, we used the raw data measured by a Stream Line coherent Doppler lidar on the coast of Lake Baikal in the summer of 2015. From these data, the height and time distributions of the of turbulent energy dissipation rate, the variance of wind speed and the integral scale of turbulence were reconstructed. For the first time from lidar measurements, quantitative estimates of the dissipation rate and the integral scale of turbulence inside the LLJ were obtained with a sufficiently high accuracy. An excess of the dissipation rate by 1-2 orders in the lower part of the LLJ above the corresponding value in the upper part of the LLJ is revealed. In the center of the jet stream, the integral scale of turbulence is of the order of 100 m, which is 2-3 times less than the effective thickness of the LLJ.

J	Miler, O; Straile, D				Miler, Oliver; Straile, Dietmar			How to cope with a superior enemy? Plant defence strategies in response to annual herbivore outbreaks	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												P>1. The perfoliate pondweed Potamogeton perfoliatus L. constitutes large monospecific macrophyte patches in many Central European lakes. Correlative evidence from the field suggests that P. perfoliatus is under an increasing grazing pressure during its short vegetation period from May to September due to seasonal outbreaks of the aquatic moth Acentria ephemerella Denis & Schiffermuller. We used a mesocosm experiment to determine the influence of A. ephemerella herbivory on P. perfoliatus shoot development and resting bud production and to study the defence strategies of this macrophyte. 2. Herbivory resulted in a reduction of the P. perfoliatus vegetation period by more than 2 months thereby reducing the average resting bud size and the overall resting bud biomass sevenfold. This suggests that besides its severe immediate effects, herbivory affects P. perfoliatus growth and dynamics also during the subsequent season. 3. As a response to herbivory P. perfoliatus translocated nutrients (phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N)) from leaves towards buds. Acentria ephemerella larvae had a high P content, implying P limitation of larval growth especially within the herbivory treatment. This suggests that at least the P translocation from leaves towards resting buds may be viewed as an anti-predator strategy rather than as a nutrient conservation strategy. 4. Acentria ephemerella herbivory changed the allocation strategy of P. perfoliatus in the size versus number of resting buds: only the number, but not the size of resting buds was reduced under shoot grazing by Acentria ephemerella. This change in the number versus size trade-off might allow the plant to produce a minimum resting bud size necessary for successful sprouting in the next spring. 5. Synthesis. Overall, our results suggest an escape syndrome (after Agrawal & Fishbein, Ecology, 87 (2006) S132) as a defence strategy against herbivory for P. perfoliatus, consisting of a shortening of the growth period, a translocation of nutrients and a change in allocation strategy. The increased plant senescence that was accompanied by the shortening of the growth period has further implications for the usage of macrophyte patches as a habitat for invertebrates and fishes and for the structure of littoral food webs.

About 11,000 years ago' the summer monsoons of central Africa moved into Egypt, and temporary lakes or playas were formed. The Nabta Playa depression, which is one of the largest in southern Egypt, is a kidney-shaped basin of roughly 10 km by 7 km in area(2-4). We report the discovery of megalithic alignments and stone circles ne?a to locations of Middle and Late Neolithic communities at Nabta, which suggest the early development of a complex society. The southward shift of the monsoons in the Late Neolithic age rendered the area once again hyperarid and uninhabitable some 4,800 radiocarbon years before the present (years BP). This well-determined date establishes that the ceremonial complex of Nabta, which has alignments to cardinal and solstitial directions, was a very early megalithic expression of ideology and astronomy. Five megalithic alignments within the playa deposits radiate outwards from megalithic structures, which may have been funerary structures. The organization of the megaliths suggests a symbolic geometry that integrated death, water, and the Sun. An exodus from the Nubian Desert at similar to 4,800 years sp may have stimulated social differentiation and cultural complexity in predynastic Upper Egypt.																			0028-0836					APR 2	1998	392	6675					488	491		10.1038/33131	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/33131													WOS:000072875200056

River and estuary movements of yellow-stage American eels Anguilla rostrata, using a hydrophone array	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												Patterns of summertime movement and habitat use of yellow-stage American eels Anguilla rostrata within York River and estuary and Gaspe Bay (Gaspesia, Quebec, Canada) were examined using acoustic telemetry. Fifty fish were tagged with acoustic transmitters and released, either in the river or in the upper estuary, and their patterns of movement and habitat use were monitored at short spatial and temporal scales during the summer months using a dense hydrophone array. Approximately half of the fish released in the river swam to the estuary; two-thirds of the fish released within the estuary did not move out of the estuary. Anguilla rostrata were detected more frequently and had a greater areal range of detections during night, suggesting greater nocturnal activity. Longitudinal movements within the estuary tended to occur nocturnally, with upstream movements from early to late evening, and downstream movements from late evening to early morning. Approximately one-third of fish showed a regular pattern of movement, tending to reside in the deeper, downstream part of the estuary during day and in the shallower, more upstream part of the estuary during night. Approximately a quarter of fish, located in the upper estuary, remained upstream during both night and day. The remaining fish showed patterns intermediate between these two.

J	Cattaneo, A				Cattaneo, A			Algal seston and periphyton distribution along a stream linking a chain of lakes on the Canadian Shield	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The effect of natural impoundments on the longitudinal distribution of summer sestonic and periphytic algal biomass was assessed in a stream linking a chain of lakes in the Laurentian mountains of Quebec. Algal seston biomass was higher at lake outlets but declined rapidly downstream. Periphyton on gravel generally had larger biomasses at lake outlets, but on boulders, the dominant substratum, periphyton was unaffected by distance from the upstream lake. However, the only lake in the set larger than 100 ha, Lac Achigan, had a significant positive effect on the biomass of all the algal assemblages. Periphyton on boulders was significantly correlated with the distance from the headwater. The longitudinal trend in periphyton biomass was unimodal, with the peak around 4 km from the headwater. When the effect of lakes was statistically removed, algal seston distribution also followed a unimodal longitudinal trend parallel to that of periphyton. Simple geomorphic variables like distance downstream from the nearest lake and distance from headwater account for a significant portion of the variation of algal seston (52%) and periphyton (64%) in this stream.																			0018-8158					JUN 14	1996	325	3					183	192		10.1007/BF00014983	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00014983													WOS:A1996UZ71200002
J	MONISMITH, SG; IMBERGER, J; MORISON, ML				MONISMITH, SG; IMBERGER, J; MORISON, ML			CONVECTIVE MOTIONS IN THE SIDEARM OF A SMALL RESERVOIR	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We present observations of the diurnal formation of horizontal temperature gradients in the surface waters of a sidearm of a small water supply reservior at a time during summer when radiative heating and vertical stratification of the reservoir's waters were both quite strong. Our measurements show that because the closed end of the sidearm was relatively shallow, daytime heating and nighttime cooling created larger temperature changes there than in the body of the lake, resulting in large horizontal temperature gradients that drove strongly sheared, horizontal exchanges. Because of more vigorous turbulent mixing during cooling, cooling-driven flows were slower and of greater vertical extent than were heating-driven flows. The overall flow exhibited inertia in that it was not in phase with the daily heating cycle. Averaged over the daily cycle, there appeared to be a net residual flow, with surface waters flowing out and metalimnetic waters flowing in. This thermally driven flow, the "thermal siphon," greatly enhanced the rate of horizontal exchange between the sidearm and the body of the reservoir such that the time required to replace water in the sidearm when the siphon is operating is substantially less than estimates with conventional formulae based on horizontal turbulent diffusion.

Given the ecological relevance of this group in these Antarctic microbial foodwebs, we carried out further molecular analyses (clone libraries and 18S Illumina high throughput sequencing) to characterize their phylogenetic diversity. The results of this study significantly increased the retrieved Chrysophyceae biodiversity. Clone libraries in two selected lakes (one oligotrophic and one mesotrophic) yielded 12 different chrysophycean OTUs, whereas 81 Swarm OTUs were recovered from six lakes using Illumina HiSeq. With the combination of both methods, we observed sequences of all the chrysophyte known clades, although most of the diversity belonged to Clade D, a group comprising mixotrophic and heterotrophic species. The percentage of reads for this clade in Illumina HiSeq ranged from 30% to 96% of the total Chrysophyceae reads. Based on experiments and observations, we also describe the main ecological traits of this group: the dominant taxa were small pigmented flagellates, well adapted to survive in oligotrophic systems, sometimes abundant under ice-cover subjected to low light intensities, and that have phagotrophic behavior. The used combination of methods allowed us to characterize the biodiversity and ecology of the Chrysophyceae, the dominant phytoplankton group in the oligotrophic lakes of this Maritime Antarctic region.

Permafrost, geomorphic, and hydroclimatic controls on mercury, methylmercury, and lead concentrations and exports in Old Crow River, arctic western Canada	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY												Permafrost degradation has been implicated as a dominant control on riverine mercury fluxes in arctic watersheds. However, the importance of permafrost thaw on fluxes of mercury, methylmercury, and trace metals such as lead-relative to other geomorphic and hydroclimatic controls-remains unclear. To investigate these controls, we conducted -weekly water chemistry sampling at the mouth of the Old Crow River, a pristine, 13,900 km(2) watershed in arctic Canada underlain entirely by continuous permafrost. Mercury, methylmercury, and lead concentrations were low on average (similar to 2 ng/L, 0.04 ng/L, 0.8 mu g/L, respectively), and peaked during the freshet (< 7 ng/L, 0.11 ng/L, 11 mu g/L, respectively). The trace elements had strong positive association with suspended sediment, and were mobilized during periods of high discharge (freshet and rainfall). Summer time sampling of major tributaries and at thaw slumps revealed that trace element concentrations were not elevated downstream of thaw slumps or thermokarst lakes across the watershed. Ubiquitous thermokarst in the Old Crow basin did not result in anomalously high catchment-scale concentrations, fluxes, and yields of mercury, methylmercury, nor lead. Rather, warming-driven increases in precipitation and elevated discharge during freshet and rainfall promoted permafrost and talik river bank erosion. This erosion, which was controlled by landscape and geomorphic factors, supplied short-lived increases in particle-bound trace element flux.

They are home to a diverse group of flora and fauna, and provide water for drinking, irrigation, and recreational purposes. Miangaran endorheic wetland in SW Iran serves as the discharge point of the municipal wastewater of a nearby city; it receives agricultural return flows as well. To identify the consequences of the wastewater input, 29 water samples from the wetland's body and inlet streams were analyzed for physico-chemical parameters. The average EC of the wetland was 405 mu s12.3/cm; calcium, magnesium, and bicarbonate were the dominant ions. The average pH was high, about 8.6, due to carbonate dissolution in the drainage area which was exacerbated by photosynthesis process inside the wetland. The concentration of phosphate was over the eutrophication limit of 0.1 mg/L. Nitrate contents varied from 5.7 to 12.3 mg/L. Trophic state index based on total nitrogen was about 63, falling within the eutrophic group. Heavy metal concentrations were generally higher than WHO drinking limits. Highest values of EC, nutrients, and metals were observed in the south and northwest, clearly signifying the role of wastewater input as the main source of contamination, which has resulted in the eutrophication of the wetland.					; Esmaeili, Mahin/AAC-6084-2022	Jafari, Hadi/0000-0003-2063-7650; 													0167-6369	1573-2959				JUN	2015	187	6							357	10.1007/s10661-015-4560-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-015-4560-0								25975237					WOS:000355918600002

Linking Holocene drying trends from Lonar Lake in monsoonal central India to North Atlantic cooling events	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												We present the results of biogeochemical and mineralogical analyses on a sediment core that covers the Holocene sedimentation history of the climatically sensitive, closed, saline, and alkaline Lonar Lake in the core monsoon zone in central India. We compare our results of C/N ratios, stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes, grain-size, as well as amino acid derived degradation proxies with climatically sensitive proxies of other records from South Asia and the North Atlantic region. The comparison reveals some more or less contemporaneous climate shifts. At Lonar Lake, a general long term climate transition from wet conditions during the early Holocene to drier conditions during the late Holocene, delineating the insolation curve, can be reconstructed. In addition to the previously identified periods of prolonged drought during 4.6-3.9 and 2.0-0.6 cal ka that have been attributed to temperature changes in the Indo Pacific Warm Pool, several additional phases of shorter term climate alteration superimposed upon the general climate trend can be identified. These correlate with cold phases in the North Atlantic region. The most pronounced climate deteriorations indicated by our data occurred during 62-5.2,4.6-3.9, and 2.0-0.6 cal ka BP. The strong dry phase between 4.6 and 3.9 cal ka BP at Lonar Lake corroborates the hypothesis that severe climate deterioration contributed to the decline of the Indus Civilisation about 3.9 ka BP.

The purpose of the research was to establish the influence of environmental parameters, specifically, the water flows of Sao Francisco River, in the socioeconomic indicators of the lower course of the river, related to rice production, not only by natural but also by irrigation flood. The documentary sources and statistics were the data basis that made it possible to explain the sustainability status of each of the municipalities. The methodological approach was attached to the procedures for calculation of Municipal Sustainability Indexes (ISM), represented by Anthropogenic Impact Polygons and exhibited in radar charts. Therefore, it was found that the low flow of the river, generated by the Xingo dam, and the saline intrusion has converted the Sao Francisco River into a large lake. In this context, the rice production of the region fell in the areas of natural flooding and increase in the irrigation model at the expense of the low sustainability of the environment.																			2340-7743					JAN-JUN	2018		11					83	95		10.17561/at.11.2956	http://dx.doi.org/10.17561/at.11.2956													WOS:000437526300008

A chemical treatment, based on phosphorus inactivation with small doses of iron sulphate, was undertaken in 2006-2007. Nitrate-rich groundwater flowing from seepage springs was directed into the lake hypolimnion to increase redox potential since 2008. Phosphorus internal loading was reduced by more than 80% as a result of restoration treatment. In the profundal zone, where P release from the bottom sediments prevailed throughout the year, it decreased from 13.02 mg P m(-2) day(-1) in 2010 to 2.81 mg P m(-2) day(-1) in 2015. Meanwhile, in the littoral zone, P accumulation in bottom sediments predominated; hence, the mean value of internal loading was increasing from 2.61 mg P m(-2) day(-1) in 2011 to 10.24 mg P m(-2) day(-1) in 2015. The annual P load from the bottom sediments in the profundal zone was much higher than from the littoral zone as a result of (i) a higher P release in most years and (ii) the greater area of this zone (82% of the lake's area). The fraction of residual phosphorus (Res-P) has the largest share, and in recent years, this has shown a tendency to decrease. The sum of bioavailable fractions was low (average 5.7%) showing a downward trend in recent years. Sustainable restoration of the lake resulted in a slow but steady decreasing trend in internal phosphorus loading.

The true water area includes not only the body of water but also the water area under emerged-plants and/or floating-leave plants in the lake. Statistical POLSAR image analysis is carried out for both X- and L-band data, based on the three-component scattering power decomposition method, where the decomposed components are surface scattering, double-bounce scattering and volume scattering components. From the results of the image analysis for the L-band POLSAR data acquired by Pi-SAR system, it is found that strong double-bounce scattering can be observed at the vicinity of the boundary region between water area and the surrounding emerged-plants area in early and middle summer. This phenomenon is an important factor for environmental monitoring. To verify the generating mechanism of the double-bounce scattering, the Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) polarimetric scattering analysis is also executed for a simplified boundary model, which simulates the local boundary region around the lake and consists of lots of vertical thin dielectric pillars on a perfect electric conductor (PEC) plate or on a PEC and dielectric hybrid plate. Taking into account the polarimetric feature of the double-bounce scattering obtained by both the FDTD and POLSAR image analyses, one can distinguish the actual water area from the bush of the emerged-plants around the lake, even when the water area is concealed by emerged-plants and/or floating-leave plants. Consequently, it is found that by using the proposed approach, one can estimate the true water area seasonal change for the lake and the surrounding wetland.																			0916-8516	1745-1345				SEP	2007	E90B	9					2369	2375		10.1093/ietcom/e90-b.9.2369	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ietcom/e90-b.9.2369													WOS:000250094000025

Unfortunately, when it comes to analyzing these data, traditional data warehouses (DWs) and OLAP systems fall short because they rely on relational DBMSs for storage and querying, thus constraining data variety into the rigidity of a structured, fixed schema. In this paper, we investigate the performances of an MMDBMS when used to store multidimensional data for OLAP analyses. A multi-model DW would store each of its elements according to its native model; among the benefits we envision for this solution, that of bridging the architectural gap between data lakes and DWs, that of reducing the cost for ETL, and that of ensuring better flexibility, extensibility, and evolvability thanks to the combined use of structured and schemaless data. To support our investigation we define a multidimensional schema for the UniBench benchmark dataset and an ad hoc OLAP workload for it. Then we propose and compare three logical solutions implemented on the PostgreSQL multi-model DBMS: one that extends a star schema with JSON, XML, graph-based, and key-value data; one based on a classical (fully relational) star schema; and one where all data are kept in their native form (no relational data are introduced). As expected, the full-relational implementation generally performs better than the multi-model one, but this is balanced by the benefits of MMDBMSs in dealing with variety. Finally, we give our perspective view of the research on this topic. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In certain high deposition areas of Great Britain, NO(3)(-)-based acidity can equal or exceed the contribution of SO(4)(2-)-based acidity in some upland waters. Here we apply the first-order acidity balance model (FAB) to predict the maximum N leaching from 13 study catchments at future steady state. Using mean water chemistry and catchment soils data, along with long-term default values for N sink processes, we predict NO(3)-N leaching at much higher rates than currently are being measured in surface waters, with a mean increase of 10.5 kg ha(-1) yr(-1). As a result, mean acid neutralizing capacity would decline to less than 0 meq L(-1) at 4 sites. While there are uncertainties associated with model parameterization relating to the short-term storage of N within catchment soils and vegetation, model outputs do indicate much greater leaching of N at some time in the future as steady-state is achieved.

J	Cimbleris, ACP; Kalff, J				Cimbleris, ACP; Kalff, J			Planktonic bacterial respiration as a function of C:N:P ratios across temperate lakes	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Bacterioplankton and total planktonic community respiration were measured in 14 Canadian lakes during the summer. Total planktonic community respiration (O-2 consumption and CO2 production) was best predicted by total phosphorus (TP), with respiratory rates increasing at higher TP levels. The bacterioplankton respiration alone was less well linked to nutrient concentrations. Yet, the rates of both planktonic and bacterial CO2 production changed similarly with changes in the C:N ratio, with the bacterial fraction, on average, contributing about 42% of the total planktonic respiratory rates. Bacterial carbon respired was uncoupled from oxygen consumption, with resultant average planktonic respiratory quotient (RQ) close to 2. Bacterioplankton respiratory rates are affected by a negative relationship between specific aerobic respiration and bacterial biomass. Higher bacterial specific oxygen consumption rates (mu g O-2 cell(-1) d(-1)) were observed with increasing C:N and C:P ratios, suggesting an increase in maintenance cost at the low cell densities observed in oligotrophic waters. Phosphorus appeared as the limiting nutrient in these lakes and determined total planktonic respiratory rates, but epilimnetic bacterial respiration was mainly related to the DOG: nutrient ratios.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1998	384						89	100		10.1023/A:1003496815969	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1003496815969													WOS:000078947900009

Slug Stability in Flaring Geometries and Ramifications for Lava Lake Degassing	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH												Long-lived, persistently active lava lakes are rare but have been studied extensively because they may provide a natural laboratory for studying magmatic convection in basaltic and other low-viscosity volcanoes. However, lava lakes differ from other volcanic systems in various ways, particularly geometry: the presence of the lava lake requires a sudden and significant flaring of the conduit. The goal of this paper is to advance our understanding of the effect that a sudden increase in the conduit width has on the stability of large gas slugs and bubbles ascending from the plumbing system. We investigate this question by linking analog laboratory experiments to direct numerical simulations in two dimensions. We find that the rapid change in the geometry associated with the transition from the conduit to the lava lake causes large gas slugs to break up. The nondimensional regime over which we observe the breakup depends sensitively on the flare angle of the lava lake and the importance of inertial effects in the flow, implying that degassing-related eruptive activity at open-system volcanoes is sensitive to the upper conduit and lake geometries. Applying this idea to the likely geometries and viscosities of actual lava lakes, our study suggests that all lava lakes except Erebus fall well within the regime where large gas slugs are prone to breakup.					; Soldati, Arianna/F-3206-2017	Cashman, Katharine/0000-0001-9312-8377; Rust, Alison/0000-0001-5095-7749; Qin, Zhipeng/0000-0003-4372-4327; Soldati, Arianna/0000-0001-9835-4429; Velazquez Santana, Liannie Coral/0000-0002-1916-6997													2169-9313	2169-9356				DEC	2018	123	12					10431	10448		10.1029/2018JB016113	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2018JB016113													WOS:000455996900006

Evidence of impaired health in yellow perch (Perca flavescens) from a biological mercury hotspot in northeastern north America	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												Few studies have investigated the effects of mercury (Hg) on wild fish from remote areas, even though these fish can have high total Hg concentrations. In Kejimkujik National Park and National Historic Site (KNPNHS), Nova Scotia, Canada, concentrations of total Hg in many yellow perch (Perca flavescens) currently exceed the estimated threshold level for adverse effects in fish (0.2 mu gHgg1 (wet wt), whole body). To determine whether Hg exposure is adversely affecting the general health of these fish, the authors collected male and female perch in the fall of 2009 and 2010 from 12 lakes within KNPNHS. The health endpoints condition, liver somatic index (LSI), and macrophage aggregates (MAs; indicators of oxidative stress and tissue damage) in the liver, kidney, and spleen were examined, and in female perch were compared between lakes and related to Hg concentrations measured in the muscle and liver tissue. No negative relationships between fish condition or LSI and Hg were found. However, within the liver, kidney, and spleen tissues of females, the relative area occupied by MAs was positively related to both muscle and liver Hg concentrations, indicating the health of these perch was adversely affected at the cellular level. These findings raise concerns for the health of these perch as well as for other wild fish populations known to have similarly elevated Hg concentrations. Environ. Toxicol. Chem. 2013;32:627637.

J	Chapman, LJ; Hulen, KG				Chapman, LJ; Hulen, KG			Implications of hypoxia for the brain size and gill morphometry of mormyrid fishes	JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												The mormyrids are well known for their remarkable electrogenic and electrolocation capabilities and exceptionally large cerebellum that may account for much of their total oxygen consumption. Mormyrids living in oxygen-deficient waters may use oxygen efficiently, protecting the brain from hypoxia damage; and/or brain size may be reduced. This study compares the TFL, gill lamellar density, gill lamellar area, total gill surface area, and brain size of two species of mormyrids from extremely hypoxic waters in Uganda (Gnathonemus victoriae and Petrocephalus catostoma) to two open-water species (Mormyrus kannume and Gnathonemus longibarbis) from the same region. In addition, interdemic variation was considered by comparing swamp populations of G. victoriae and P. catostoma to open-water populations of the same species. Total gill surface area of all species fell within the upper range for freshwater fishes. However, there were both intraspecific and interspecific differences in gill characters. Interdemic comparisons showed larger gill size in swamp-dwelling populations. Brain size varied among species; larger brains were characteristic of species from well-oxygenated waters. Large gill surface area may permit survival of mormyrids in oxygen-stressed environments; however, mechanisms compensating for hypoxia seem to be inadequate to support a brain size as large as that seen in fish from well-oxygenated waters.																			0952-8369	1469-7998				AUG	2001	254		4				461	472		10.1017/S0952836901000966	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0952836901000966													WOS:000170432300006

Hakone is a world-famous resort that more than 20 million tourists visit every year to enjoy various kinds of hot springs and spectacular landscapes of the caldera. Study focus: Monthly water budget of Lake Ashinoko was investigated based on the correlation between monthly potential inflow of water to the lake and monthly outflow of water from the lake. Potential inflow consists of rainfall on the lake and catchment area, and monthly out flow is the change in water of the lake plus evaporation and intake from Fukara gate for irrigation. New hydrological insights for the region: We found that only about a quarter of the rainfall during a prior few months flows into the lake. Besides that, there is stationary inflow. About 45 % of the rainfall on the catchment area infiltrates into the ground. Many observational facts and analytical results indicate that rainfall on the central cones penetrates into the volcanic edifice, and does not flow into the lake. It is proposed that the water stored in the volcanic edifice and heated by a reservoir of magma that is thought to exist at a depth of about 10 km is a major source of Hakone thermal water.																				2214-5818				APR	2020	28								100682	10.1016/j.ejrh.2020.100682	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrh.2020.100682													WOS:000522682000017

Fish population dynamics were density-dependent, and harvest by anglers followed a sigmoid functional response. The deterministic form of the model was stable and suggested that the fishery could withstand relatively high exploitation rates. The stochastic form of the model compared management strategies using the probabilities of increased or decreased fish and angler populations and the probability that fish populations will fall below a threshold level. These calculations exposed high risks associated with management strategies based on deterministic, equilibrium equations. The probabilities of sustaining both the fish stock and angler effort increase if harvest rates are reduced below the optimum derived from deterministic models. Consideration of angler dynamics reduced the prediction error of fish stock forecasts and substantially altered risk assessments and management recommendations. If angler dynamics were ignored, the optimal exploitation rate and the risk of overfishing would be overestimated. Lake sport fishery assessments can be improved by coupling models of fish dynamics at the scale of individual lakes with angler models at the larger scale of lake districts.

Ambient heatwaves accompanied by unusual droughts are major threats to poverty eradication in Tanzania. Due to sparsity of observation data and proper heatwave detection metrics, there has been a paucity of knowledge about heatwave events in Tanzania. In this study, the Heatwave Magnitude Index daily (HWMId) was adopted to quantitatively analyze heatwave characteristics throughout Tanzania at mid-21st century (2041-2070) and end of 21st century (2071-2100), relative to the reference period (1983-2012) using the CHIRTS-daily quasi-global high-resolution temperature dataset and climate simulations from a multi-modal ensemble of median scenarios (RCP4.5, from CORDEX-Africa). The results showed that moderate to super-extreme heatwaves occurred in Tanzania between 1983 and 2012, particularly in 1999, when ultra-extreme heatwaves (HWMId > 32) occurred in the Lake Victoria basin. It is projected that by mid-21st century, the upper category of HWMId would be hotter and longer, and would occur routinely in Tanzania. The spatial extent of all of the HWMId categories is projected to range from 34% to 73% by the end of the 21st century with a duration of 8 to 35 days, compared to 1 to 5 days during the reference period. These findings will contribute to increasing public awareness of the need for adaptation.

Molecular fingerprinting of lacustrian cyanobacterial communities: regional patterns in summer diversity	FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY												The assessment of lacustrian water quality is necessary to comply with environmental regulations. At the regional scale, difficulties reside in the selection of representative lakes. Given the risks towards water quality associated with phytoplankton blooms, a mesoscale survey was carried out in Irish lakes to identify patterns in the distribution and diversity of planktonic cyanobacteria. A stratified sampling strategy was carried out via geographic information systems (GIS) analysis of river catchment attributes due to the range of hydrogeomorphological features and the high number of lakes within the study area. 16S rRNA gene denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis showed variation between the cyanobacterial communities sampled, with lower occurrence of cyanobacteria in August concomitant to increased wind and precipitation regimes. Multivariate analysis delineated three ecoregions based on land cover typology and revealed significant patterns in the distribution of cyanobacterial diversity. A majority of filamentous cyanobacteria genotypes occurred in larger lakes contained river catchments with substantial forest cover. In contrast, higher diversity of spherical cyanobacteria genotypes was observed in lakes of lesser trophic state. In the context of aquatic resource management, the combined use of GIS-based sampling strategy and molecular methods offers promising prospects for assessing microbial community structure at varying scales of space and time.						touzet, nicolas/0000-0002-8524-9184													0168-6496	1574-6941				DEC	2013	86	3					444	457		10.1111/1574-6941.12172	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1574-6941.12172								23802655					WOS:000326960000007

Detection and expression of genes for phosphorus metabolism in picocyanobacteria from the Laurentian Great Lakes	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The pelagic regions of Lake Superior and eastern Lake Erie (Laurentian Great Lakes) are typically phosphorus (P)limited environments, and picocyanobacteria of the genus Synechococcus spp. are prominent primary producers during the summer. As a proxy for their utilization of organic P, the expression of two genes, phnD and phoX, was monitored. The phnD gene encodes the phosphonate binding protein of the ABC-type phosphonate transporter, whereas the phoX gene encodes a calcium-dependent alkaline phosphatase. Furthermore, to assess the ability of freshwater Synechococcus spp. to substitute sulfolipids for phospholipids, sqdX gene (cyanobacterial sulfolipid synthase) expression was examined. We employed PCR primers to detect the presence of all three genes in the endemic Synechococcus spp., and RT-PCR assays of cultured freshwater strains and environmental samples to assess the degree of P-stress in the phytoplankton. We show that the phnD gene was constitutively expressed, suggesting that freshwater picocyanobacteria were metabolizing exogenous phosphonate compounds in lakes Erie and Superior. By contrast, phoX was regulated by P bioavailability. We also provide evidence that sqdX is expressed during increased growth rates in phosphorus-replete conditions, suggesting that sulfolipid synthesis is not a P conservation mechanism for freshwater Synechococcus spp. (C) 2013 International Association for Great Lakes Research.

Volcanic hydrothermal systems as potential analogues of Martian sulphate-rich terrains	NETHERLANDS JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												Remote sensing observations and rover missions have documented the presence of sulphate-rich mineral associations on Mars. Many of these minerals are paleo-indicators of hydrous, acidic and oxidising environments that must have prevailed in Mars' distant past, contrary to the present conditions. Furthermore, occurrences of silica together with high Cl and Br concentrations in Martian soils and rocks represent fingerprints of chemically atypical fluids involved in processes operating on the surface or at shallow depth. From field observations at representative active volcanoes in subduction settings, supported by geochemical modelling, we demonstrate that volcanic hydrothermal systems are capable of producing Mars-like secondary mineral assemblages near lakes, springs and fumaroles through the action of acidic fluids. Water-gas-rock interactions, together with localised flow paths of water and fumarolic gas emitted from associated subaerial vents, lead to deposition of a range of sulphates, including gypsum, jarosite, alunite, epsomite and silica. Evaporation, vapour separation and fluid mixing in (near-) surface environments with strong gradients in temperature and fluid chemistry further promote the diversity of secondary minerals. The mineralogical and chemical marks are highly variable in space and time, being subject to fluctuations in ambient conditions as well as to changes in the status of volcanic-hydrothermal activity. It is concluded that active processes in modern volcanic-geothermal systems may be akin to those that created several of the sulphate-rich terrains in the early history of Mars.

J	Garcia, E; Poulain, AJ; Amyot, M; Ariya, PA				Garcia, E; Poulain, AJ; Amyot, M; Ariya, PA			Diel variations in photoinduced oxidation of Hg0 in freshwater	CHEMOSPHERE												Experiments have been conducted to determine diel variations in photoinduced Hg-0 oxidation in lake water under natural Hg-(aq)(0) concentrations. Pseudo-first-order rates of photooxidation (V) were calculated for water freshly collected in a Canadian Shield lake, Lake Croche (45 degrees 56' N, 74 degrees 00' W), at different periods of the day and subsequently incubated in the dark. Hg-0 oxidation rates ranged from 0.02 to 0.07 h(-1), increasing from sunrise to noon and then decreasing throughout the remainder of the day. These changes paralleled those in sunlight intensity integrated over 1 h preceding water collection, and suggested that the water freshly collected in daylight was rich in photochemically produced Hg-0 oxidants. It was also estimated that under intense solar radiation, even if oxidation rates reached a peak, reduction of Hg(II) was the prevalent redox process. Inversely, Hg-0 oxidation overcame DGM production during the night or at periods of weaker light intensity. Overall, these findings explain the decreases in the DGM pool generally observed overnight. They also support previous reports that, during summer days, volatilization of Hg-0 from water represent an important step in the Hg cycle in freshwater systems. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Quist, MC; Guy, CS; Bernot, RJ; Stephen, JL				Quist, MC; Guy, CS; Bernot, RJ; Stephen, JL			Factors related growth and survival of larval walleyes: implications for recruitment in a southern Great Plains reservoir	FISHERIES RESEARCH												Larval fishes, limnological characteristics, and zooplankton populations were sampled from Glen Elder Reservoir, Kansas, during 1999-2001 to determine factors associated with growth and survival of larval walleyes (StizoStedion vitreum). Ichthyoplankton populations were sampled weekly from April to June during all years using paired conical nets. Water temperature and zooplankton populations were sampled at each ichthyoplankton sampling site. Approximately, 70% of all larval fishes and 80% of the larval walleyes were sampled in the upper reservoir during all years. Cyprinidae and Centrarchidae were the only taxa that were more abundant in the main reservoir than the upper reservoir. Despite similarities in zooplankton abundance between years, recruitment of walleyes in 1999 was the lowest in nearly 20 years, while moderate year classes were produced in 2000 and 2001. During 1999, low, variable spring temperatures resulted in poor growth of larval walleyes. Poor growth of walleyes, coupled with high densities of larval gizzard shad (Dorosoma ccpedianum), resulted in poor recruitment during 1999. Walleyes grew faster in 2000 and 2001 and were able to consume larval gizzard shad resulting in moderate recruitment. These results suggest that abiotic conditions mediate biotic interactions and that both abiotic and biotic characteristics are important for regulating walleye recruitment dynamics.

Late Quaternary developments of Mediterranean oaks in the Atlantic domain of the Iberian Peninsula: The case of the Cantabrian region (N Spain)	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												A synthesis of the occurrence of the evergreen oak (Quercus ilex-type) in the Cantabrian region (northern Spain) is presented on the basis of integrated charcoal and pollen analyses. Archaeological charcoal comes largely from sites along the littoral and pre-littoral territories of the Basque Country, Cantabria and Asturias dated from 45 to 3.7 Kyr cal BP, and culturally ranging from Mousterian to Iron Age. Pollen information is produced from a few archaeological sites but mainly from peats and lake sediments. Q ilex-type is observed as early as at 45-30 Kyr cal BP, with sporadic occurrences in vegetation contexts dominated by Pinus sylvestris-type, which was widely exploited by Mousterian and Aurignacian inhabitants. Afterwards, during the Upper Palaeolithic, there is an important decline, and Q ilex-type is hardly present between 29 and 15 Kyr cal BP, with open environments dominated by heathland shrubs. From Late Magdalenian onwards, Q. ilex-type expanded again, remaining in the landscape of the Cantabrian region throughout the Holocene, although subordinated in deciduous oak forests under the influence of oceanic climate conditions. Q. flex-type had a more favourable position than deciduous Quercus across the Cantabrian, southern slopes and northwest of the adjacent Iberian Cordillera, where oceanic influences have become attenuated by summer drought and continentality.

Mycobiota of outdoor air that can cause asthma: a case study from Lake Manzala, Egypt	MYCOSPHERE												Continuous sampling of airspora in Lake Manzala was carried out monthly over a period of 1 year at five sites with an automated air sampler on Czapek's yeast extract, DG-18 and potato dextrose agar media plates. A total of 71780 mould- and 560 yeast colony-forming units were recovered from 600 exposures and the isolated taxa were assigned to 28 genera and 43 species. A greater presence of fungal spores occurred in the summer. Aspergillus niger, Cladosporium cladosporioides, Epicoccum nigrum, Aureobasidium pullulans, Alternaria cheiranthi, Penicillium chrysogenum, Aspergillus fumigatus and Alternaria alternata were the predominant species. Many of the identified species have an aerodynamic diameter (dae) of 1.5-10 mu m that can deeply penetrate into the lungs. Aspergillus, Cladosporium, Penicillium, and Alternaria that had the greatest frequencies in air of Lake Manzala are strongly associated with allergic respiratory disease, especially asthma, in Port Said and Ismailia governorates. A comprehensive model of factors that contribute to asthma in the region is needed and this can be a useful tool for planning efforts and disease prevention. The obtained results indicated that the fungi of air should be considered when the quality of Egyptian air is assessed.					Abdel-Azeem, Ahmed/KJM-2929-2024; M. Abdel-Azeem, Ahmed/I-3637-2015	M.

J	Kellner, E; Pires, EC				Kellner, E; Pires, EC			The influence of thermal stratification on the hydraulic behavior of waste stabilization ponds	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY					1st International Regional Conference on Waste Stabilization Ponds in Latin America	OCT 24-27, 2000	CALI, COLOMBIA					Thermal stratification, which is characterized by a high vertical thermal gradient, is usually observed in deep lakes. However, although waste stabilization ponds have small depths, their high turbidity provides favorable conditions for the occurrence of this phenomenon, mainly during summer. During that time of the year, the layers nearest to the surface concentrate a larger amount of thermal energy compared to the deeper layers, which results in a temperature difference between the surface and the bottom of the pond. As a consequence a density profile appears, with the less dense layers located at the surface of the pond and the densest ones close to the bottom. This stratification in the water column induces alterations in the flow pattern and a decrease of the useful volume of the pond. This paper presents a mathematical model developed to forecast the conditions of thermal stratification in waste stabilization ponds and the volume actually used for wastewater treatment. With these values it is possible to correct the average residence time of the liquid in the pond. The theoretical results were compared with experimental observations, and maximum differences of 15% between the calculated and observed temperature profiles were found.

Green and cool roofs to mitigate urban heat island effects in the Chicago metropolitan area: evaluation with a regional climate model	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												The effects of urban heat islands (UHIs) have a substantial bearing on the sustainability of cities and environs. This paper examines the efficacy of green and cool roofs as potential UHI mitigation strategies to make cities more resilient against UHI. We have employed the urbanized version of the Weather Research and Forecasting (uWRF) model at high (1 km) resolution with physically-based rooftop parameterization schemes (conventional, green and cool), a first-time application to the Chicago metropolitan area. We simulated a hot summer period (16-18 August 2013) and assessed (i) UHI reductions for different urban landuse with green/cool roofs, (ii) the interaction of lake breeze and UHI, and (iii) diurnal boundary layer dynamics. The performance of u WRF was evaluated using sensible heat flux and air temperature measurements from an urban mini-field campaign. The simulated roof surface energy balance captured the energy distribution with respective rooftop algorithms. Results showed that daytime roof temperature reduced and varied linearly with increasing green roof fractions, from less than 1 degrees C for the case of 25% green roof to similar to 3 degrees C during peak daytime for 100% green roof. Diurnal transitions from land to lake breeze and vice versa had a substantial impact on the daytime cycle of roof surface UHI, which had a 3-4 hour lag in comparison to 2 m UHI. Green and cool roofs reduced horizontal and vertical wind speeds and affected lower atmosphere dynamics, including reduced vertical mixing, lower boundary layer depth, and weaker convective rolls. The lowered wind speeds and vertical mixing during daytime led to stagnation of air near the surface, potentially causing air quality issues. The selection of green and cool roofs for UHI mitigation should therefore carefully consider the competing feedbacks. The new results for regional land-lake circulations and boundary layer dynamics from this study may be extended to other urbanized areas, particularly to coastal areas.

(Cyprinidae), in Lake Balaton, Hungary	SYSTEMATIC PARASITOLOGY												In the summer of 2014, mass mortality of the sichel, Pelecus cultratus (L.), was observed in Lake Balaton, Hungary. Parasitological examination conducted in the framework of a complete diagnostic survey revealed myxozoan infections. Two species of Myxobolus Butschli, 1892 were found, one in the gill lamellae and another in the eyes. Following this mass mortality, 113 sichel specimens were examined during a 14-month period. Gill infection with scattered spores in the lamellae was found in 51 fish, while infection in the eyes was recorded in three specimens only. Based upon the morphological and molecular biological data the species from the gills is described here as Myxobolus peleci n. sp. and the species from the eye as M. cultrati n. sp. The 18S rDNA sequences of the two species proved that they differ from all known Myxobolus spp. with sequence data available in the GenBank database. Histological examinations revealed that the spores found in the gill lamellae were derived from plasmodia developing in and around the afferent branchial arteries of the gill arches. No mortality of sichel was recorded in 2015. Infection with these two Myxobolus spp. does not seem to play a role in the mortality of the host fish.					; Székely, Csaba/V-2655-2019; Szekely, Csaba/F-5246-2012	Molnar, Kalman/0000-0002-6138-7929; Cech, Gabor/0000-0003-4060-4522; Szekely, Csaba/0000-0001-8831-9099													0165-5752	1573-5192				SEP	2016	93	7					667	677		10.1007/s11230-016-9651-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11230-016-9651-y								27522366					WOS:000383704900004

Wind-Blown Dust Modeling Using a Backward-Lagrangian Particle Dispersion Model	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY												Presented here is a new dust modeling framework that uses a backward-Lagrangian particle dispersion model coupled with a dust emission model, both driven by meteorological data from the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model. This new modeling framework was tested for the spring of 2010 at multiple sites across northern Utah. Initial model results for March-April 2010 showed that the model was able to replicate the 27-28 April 2010 dust event; however, it was unable to reproduce a significant wind-blown dust event on 30 March 2010. During this event, the model significantly underestimated PM2.5 concentrations (4.7 vs 38.7 mu g m(-3)) along the Wasatch Front. The backward-Lagrangian approach presented here allowed for the easy identification of dust source regions with misrepresented land cover and soil types, which required an update to WRF. In addition, changes were also applied to the dust emission model to better account for dust emitted from dry lake basins. These updates significantly improved dust model simulations, with the modeled PM2.5 comparing much more favorably to observations (average of 30.3 mu g m(-3)). In addition, these updates also improved the timing of the frontal passage within WRF. The dust model was also applied in a forecasting setting, with the model able to replicate the magnitude of a large dust event, albeit with a 2-h lag. These results suggest that the dust modeling framework presented here has potential to replicate past dust events, identify source regions of dust, and be used for short-term forecasting applications.

Characterising alligator weed (Alternanthera philoxeroides; Amaranthaceae) invasion at a northern New Zealand lake	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Exotic plant invasions are a key threat to New Zealand biodiversity. Alligator weed (Alternanthera philoxeroides; Amaranthaceae) is an invasive, herbaceous weed native to South America. Little is known about its dynamics in natural ecosystems in its introduced range, despite known agricultural impacts. We quantified alligator weed infestation at Lake Rotokawau, Northland, and investigated alligator weed's relationship with other vegetation, both native and exotic, over a year (Nov. 2005 to Sep. 2006). We also examined the relationship between native vegetation and 'other' exotic vegetation at the site. Alligator weed, at its peak in spring, covered over 20% of the surveyed lake margin. Plant community composition of plots without alligator weed differed significantly from invaded plots even when alligator weed itself was removed from the analysis. Uninvaded plots were characterised by low beta-diversity and predominantly terrestrial plant species, with Phormium tenax contributing 41% of within-group similarity. In contrast, invaded plots had higher beta-diversity and were characterised by a variety of emergent sedges and herbs. Alligator weed cover was negatively related to cover of natives but not cover of 'other' exotics. Alligator weed cover was not related to species richness of natives or 'other' exotics. 'Other' exotic species were positively related to native cover and richness, likely due to shared responses to favourable environmental conditions.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the capability of using combination of multispectral drone imagery with machine learning algorithm for the assessment of water quality in an artificial lake at the Jordan University of Science and Technology (JUST) campus. Several images with different resolutions under different wavebands were captured with DJI Phantom-4 drone equipped with sensors in the blue green, red, Red Edge, and Near Infrared. At the same time water samples were also collected from ten different points in the lake to analyze physical and chemical quality parameters. The spectral reflection was used to calculate multiple water body indices, and the resulting indices were correlated to water quality parameters. The indices with coefficient of determination greater than 0.7 were used to develop various artificial intelligence models (AI) such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT), Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDT), Generalized Linear Model (GLM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The results showed that among the tested models autoregressive with exogenous (NARX) ANN model has the highest prediction accuracy based on the coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.95 and relative error of 0.034. Comparison of the simulated results indicated the variability of water quality parameters with seasons and inversion accuracy was highest during the summer season. Such an approach offers a useful tool for decision-making to manage lake water quality. Future studies should include more parameters and using hyperspectral sensors for investigating quality parameters of similar water bodies.

Accelerated Organic Carbon Burial Rates Reconstructed in Elephant Butte Reservoir, New Mexico During a Megadrought	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Artificial lakes (reservoirs) accumulate sediment and organic carbon (OC) over time. We investigated sedimentation processes in a dryland reservoir and informed OC burial and potential preservation. Our study site, Elephant Butte Reservoir on the Rio Grande, New Mexico, USA receives inflows from sediment-laden, monsoon-driven flash floods. Using field data, historical reservoir sedimentation survey and river flux (water, sediment, and OC) data, we estimated sedimentation and carbon burial volumes and rates within the delta, reservoir bottom, and whole reservoir during wet (1980-1988) and dry (2007-2017/2019) climate periods. During severe drought (2021-2022), we measured suspended sediment and OC concentrations for characteristic (seasonal) phases of the river hydrograph, monitored delta sedimentation patterns, and observed river outflow plume dynamics. Measured suspended sediment concentrations (mean = 8,818 mg/l, median = 1,769 mg/l) frequently surpassed the hyperpycnal plume threshold (1,000 mg/l), especially during flash floods (maximum = 46,718 mg/l). River total OC content averaged 5.2% +/- 12.2%, increasing to 6.3% +/- 10.3% in the summer. Whole reservoir linear sedimentation averaged 3.1 +/- 1.4% (dry)-4.0 +/- 4.2% (wet) cm/yr, with higher rates on the reservoir bottom (5.0 +/- 0.3% cm/yr) than the delta (0.8 +/- 1.1% cm/yr) during drought from hyperpycnal plume deposition, potentially preserving OC. Comparisons of OC content in suspension and deposited OC in the delta indicate partial OC preservation. Estimated whole reservoir OC burial is higher during dry than wet conditions (391 +/- 43.6% vs. 82.4 +/- 56.4% g C/m2yr), suggesting that dryland reservoirs may be efficient carbon sinks during these periods.

Our analysis suggests that chironomid assemblages have responded to major and minor climatic fluctuations during the past 17 000 years, such as the Oldest Dryas, the Younger Dryas and the Bolling/Allerod events in the Lateglacial and the Preboreal Oscillation at the beginning of the Holocene. Quantitative July air temperature estimates were produced by applying a combined Norwegian and Swiss temperature inference model consisting of 274 lakes to the fossil chironomid assemblages. The Foppe record infers average July air temperatures of ca. 9.9 degrees C during the Oldest Dryas, 12.2 degrees C during most of the Bolling/Allerod and 11.1 degrees C for the Younger Dryas. Mean July air temperatures during the Preboreal were 14 degrees C. Major temperature changes were observed at the Oldest Dryas/Bolling (+2.7 degrees C), the Allerod/Younger Dryas (-2 degrees C) and the Younger Dryas/Holocene transitions (+3.9 degrees C). The temperature reconstruction also shows centennial-scale coolings of ca. 0.8-1.4 degrees C, which may be synchronous with the Aegelsee (Greenland Interstadial 1d) and the Preboreal Oscillations. A comparison of our results with other palaeoclimate records suggests noticeable temperature gradients across the Alps during the Lateglacial and early Holocene.

Spatial and temporal geochemical variability in lacustrine sedimentation in the East African Rift System: Evidence from the Kenya Rift and regional analyses	SEDIMENTOLOGY												Many previous studies on lacustrine basins in the East African Rift System have directed their attention to climatic controls on contemporary sedimentation or climate change as part of palaeoenvironmental reconstruction. In contrast, this research focuses on the impact of tectonism and volcanism on rift deposition and develops models that help to explain their roles and relative importance. The study focuses on the spatial and temporal variability in bulk sediment geochemistry from a diverse range of modern and ancient rift sediments through an analysis of 519 samples and 50 major and trace elements. The basins examined variously include, or have contained, wetlands and/or shallow to deep, fresh to hypersaline lakes. Substantial spatial variability is documented for Holocene to modern deposits in lakes Turkana, Baringo, Bogoria, Magadi and Malawi. Mio-Pleistocene sediments in the Central Kenya Rift and Quaternary deposits of the southern Kenya Rift illustrate temporal variability. Tectonic and volcanic controls on geochemical variability are explained in terms of: (i) primary controlling factors (faulting, subsidence, uplift, volcanism, magma evolution and antecedent lithologies and landscapes); (ii) secondary controls (bedrock types, rift shoulder and axis elevations, accommodation space, meteoric and hydrothermal fluids and mantle CO2); and (iii) response factors (catchment area size, orographic rains, rain shadows, vegetation densities, erosion and weathering rates, and spring/runoff ratios). The models developed have, in turn, important implications for palaeoenvironmental interpretation in other depositional basins.

The delta O-18-inferred climate conditions are divisible into three distinct stages: (1) a maximum humid era from 9.9-6.6 ka BP; (2) a gradual declining precipitation interval between 6.6-1.6 ka BP; and (3) a relatively low precipitation time window after 1.6 ka BP. Consistency of contemporaneous stalagmite Holocene delta O-18 records between Shigao and other caves in the Indian and East Asian monsoon realms support the effect of primary orbital solar forcings on monsoonal precipitation. However, statistical analysis shows a significant spatial asynchroneity of the Holocene Optimum termination in the Asian monsoon territory. The Holocene Optimum ended at 7.2-7.4 ka BP in Oman, located in the Indian monsoon region, and at 5.6-5.8 ka BP in Central China, in the East Asian monsoon zone. In Southwest China, the termination occurred between these periods, at 6.6-7.0 ka BP, and was influenced by both monsoon systems. We propose that this spatially asynchronous ending of Holocene Optimum in Asia may be attributed to sea surface temperature changes in the western tropical Pacific, which is a primary moisture source for the East Asian monsoon.					; CHANG, YU-WEI/Q-3036-2018; Shen, Chuan-Chou/JCE-1989-2023; Li, Zhizhong/ADV-8886-2022	SHEN, CHUAN-CHOU/0000-0003-2833-2771; Jiang, Xiuyang/0000-0001-9617-0431; 													1001-6538	1861-9541				MAR	2012	57	7					795	801		10.1007/s11434-011-4848-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11434-011-4848-6													WOS:000300771200015

Monitoring of potentially toxic cyanobacteria using an online multi-probe in drinking water sources	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING												Toxic cyanobacteria threaten the water quality of drinking water sources across the globe. Two such water bodies in Canada (a reservoir on the Yamaska River and a bay of Lake Champlain in Quebec) were monitored using a YSI 6600 V2-4 (YSI, Yellow Springs, Ohio, USA) submersible multi-probe measuring in vivo phycocyanin (PC) and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) fluorescence, pH, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, temperature, and turbidity in parallel. The linearity of the in vivo fluorescence PC and Chl-a probe measurements were validated in the laboratory with Microcystis aeruginosa (r(2) = 0.96 and r(2) = 0.82 respectively). Under environmental conditions, in vivo PC fluorescence was strongly correlated with extracted PC (r = 0.79) while in vivo Chl-a fluorescence had a weaker relationship with extracted Chl-a (r = 0.23). Multiple regression analysis revealed significant correlations between extracted Chl-a, extracted PC and cyanobacterial biovolume and in vivo fluorescence parameters measured by the sensors (i.e. turbidity and pH). This information will help water authorities select the in vivo parameters that are the most useful indicators for monitoring cyanobacteria. Despite highly toxic cyanobacterial bloom development 10 m from the drinking water treatment plant's (DWTP) intake on several sampling dates, low in vivo PC fluorescence, cyanobacterial biovolume, and microcystin concentrations were detected in the plant's untreated water. The reservoir's hydrodynamics appear to have prevented the transport of toxins and cells into the DWTP which would have deteriorated the water quality. The multi-probe readings and toxin analyses provided critical evidence that the DWTP's untreated water was unaffected by the toxic cyanobacterial blooms present in its source water.					prevost, michele/HOC-8215-2023														1464-0325	1464-0333				FEB	2012	14	2					579	588		10.1039/c1em10819k	http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c1em10819k								22159157					WOS:000299794900030

Biogeochemistry and biodiversity in a network of saline-alkaline lakes: Implications of ecohydrological connectivity in the Kenyan Rift Valley	ECOHYDROLOGY & HYDROBIOLOGY												The volcanic and tectonic lakes of the eastern branch of the African Great Rift Valley are exposed to multiple stressors and characterised by different levels of hydrological connectivity. Past volcanic activity generated endorheic basins, in which the nature of the bedrock, its connection with groundwater, and local climatic conditions, favoured the formation of highly alkaline soda waters. While little is known about their nutrient dynamics, most lakes in this area experience considerable microbial blooms and harbour diverse and specifically adapted microbial populations, some of which could embody novel biotechnological potential. Here we review the geochemical and (micro) biological features of a cluster of lakes distributed within the East African Rift, ranging from fresh to hypersaline, under different levels of hydrological connectivity. Possibly no other location on Earth has a comparable range of lake types in close proximity to each other and representing such a remarkable microbial biodiversity. Environmental heterogeneity and habitat connectivity among adjacent aquatic ecosystems may have positive implications in terms of regional environmental stability by enhancing the overall carrying capacity, i.e. the resilience to various forms of impact, contributing to biodiversity protection. Within these ecosystems, microbial processes encompass the entire basis of their primary production, in particular those driven by cyanobacteria. Combining a multi-disciplinary ecohydrological approach with a biogeochemical investigation of the principles underlying their functioning, our study can contribute to the development of appropriate environmental protection measures to effectively maintain their natural capital.

Economic Analysis of Solar Powered and on-Grid Trout Fish Growing Systems	2019 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ENVIRONMENT, RESOURCES AND ENERGY ENGINEERING	IOP Conference Series-Earth and Environmental Science				International Conference on Environment, Resources and Energy Engineering (EREE)	OCT 09-11, 2019	Bangkok, THAILAND					There are many dams have been established in Turkey for different aims such as electric production and irrigation. It is also benefitted from several of these dams by growing trout fish. However, the temperature of most of these dam lake water is high, particularly during the summer hot season period (from May to September) for growing trout fish. In order to cool the water of fish growing floating pool or tank by pumping cool water from depth of 25 m, a solar powered trout fish growing system that previously designed for Ataturk Dam Lake and an on-grid power system have been selected. The solar powered water cooling system mainly contains monocrystalline silicon solar panel, MPPT (maximum power point tracker), battery pack, inverter, and a submersible pump. In contrast to many components of solar powered water cooling system, to operate the submersible pump, only the electrical network as well as a control panel are required for on-grid system. The needed PV panel area, water pump power and energy during system lifetime are also determined for one fish growing unit (floating pool or water tank) by considering some technical various data. The reason for choosing as a sample of Ataturk Dam Lake for this study is that Ataturk Dam Lake is established on the Euphrates River and ranked in the first ten amongst other dam lakes in the world. The economic analysis of both these systems have been made and these systems have also been compared with uncooled (naturally cooling) system in this work. The results of the study showed us that in order to economically functioning of a small scale or a private fishery enterprise, the required minimum number of fish growing tanks are 19, 17 and 15 for solar powered cooling system, on-grid cooling system and uncooled system, respectively.

The water and sediment samples were collected from 13 sampling points in the upstream and downstream areas over the year. The results revealed significant spatial heterogeneity in N and P concentrations, with higher levels of total nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen, and nitrite nitrogen in the upstream area compared to the downstream area (p < 0.01). Total phosphorus was also significantly higher in the upstream area (p < 0.05). Seasonal variations were observed, with TN and TP levels peaking in February and August, respectively. The TN:TP ratio indicated a severe P-limited state in most periods, transitioning to a co-limited state of N and P during summer. Sediment analysis showed that TN and TP concentrations were higher in the upstream area, with no significant differences between upstream and downstream on an annual basis, exhibiting strong stoichiometric internal stability. However, seasonal differences were noted, particularly in February and November. This study highlights the complex interactions between water and sediment, emphasizing the role of sediment resuspension, water flow, and seasonal changes in nutrient dynamics. These findings provide a scientific basis for the management and protection of water quality in the Danjiangkou Reservoir, ensuring its role as a critical water source for the South-to-North Water Diversion Project.																				2073-4441				JUN 18	2025	17	12							1824	10.3390/w17121824	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w17121824													WOS:001515432200001

The validation showed that MODIS-derived LSWTs and in situ water temperatures were significantly correlated, with a coefficient of determination higher than 0.96 and a root mean square error between 1.2 degrees C and 1.8 degrees C. These results indicate MODIS LST products can be used to assess the spatial and temporal thermal behavior of Lake Taihu. A spatial analysis of daytime LSWT showed different thermal zones along the lake due to the differential heat storage capacity between the deep and shallow regions of the lake, such as the littoral and East Lake Taihu. In contrast, the nighttime LSWT showed little variation, and there was a uniform surface water temperature. Following a change in solar radiation, the annual cycle of the average LSWT (with a nearly 24 degrees C range) started to increase in January and peaked in July. In Lake Taihu, the mean nighttime LSWT from July to September rapidly warmed over the period of 2002-2013 at an average rate of 0.059 +/- 0.053 degrees C/year. Our study promotes the use of MODIS LST products in limnology through a validation using a large amount of real-time synchronous water temperature data based on high-frequency observations, which were seldom used in previous studies.

J	COLMAN, JA; ARMSTRONG, DE				COLMAN, JA; ARMSTRONG, DE			VERTICAL EDDY DIFFUSIVITY DETERMINED WITH RN-222 IN THE BENTHIC BOUNDARY-LAYER OF ICE-COVERED LAKES	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Concentration gradients of 222Rn and 226Ra were analyzed in the benthic boundary of seven ice-covered lakes to investigate vertical eddy diffusivity, Kz. Sediment-free samples, retrieved with a tubing sampler from as close to the bottom as 14 cm, showed that sharp 222Rn gradients persist over the sediments. A three-dimensional analytical mixing model indicated horizontal mixing would not supply significant amounts of 222Rn to midlake profiles in some flat-bottomed lakes under ice cover. One-dimensional analysis of the profiles permitted observation of change in Kz with height above the sediments. Computed Kz values usually decreased in a given lake toward the sediments. The range in Kz from all lakes studied was 0.30 cm2 s-1 at 3.61 m above the bottom to 3.2 .times. 10-4 cm2 s-1 at 0.23 m, both in Lake Mendota [Wisconsin, USA]. The correlation between Kz and the buoyancy density, N2, was computed: Kz = 1.2 .times. 10-5 (N2)-0.63. This relationship indicates turbulence arising from shear flow influences the vertical mixing in the winter boundary layer. Retarded mixing in the profundal boundary layer restricts vertical solute transport in some ice-covered lakes.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				MAY	1987	32	3					577	590		10.4319/lo.1987.32.3.0577	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1987.32.3.0577													WOS:A1987J684100005

This study identified the main water consumers and their likely impact on water lake level for the case of Issyk-Kul Lake Basin, Kyrgyzstan. Data on precipitation, lake level, irrigation, household and industrial water consumption from 1980 to 2014 were provided by the Department of Water Resources and Irrigation, Ministry of Agriculture and Land Reclamation of the Kyrgyz Republic. The input data was analyzed with OriginPro 8.5 for Statistical Analysis. The results indicated a decreasing irrigation water consumption from 2029.42 to 461.76 million.m(3) in 1980 and 2014, respectively. Likewise, households consumed 27.02 million.m(3) in 1980 falling to 16.55 million.m(3) in 2014, similar to the manufacture's water consumption. However, it was noted that agriculture is a high water consumer, whose water demand for irrigation rises from April to August, the period during which the precipitation also increases. Nevertheless, manufactures and household water consumption do not have timed limits of use like in agriculture, which in turn affects the lake water level. Therefore, as the rainfall increases by April to August, we suggest to harvest and only use the rainfall water during its abundance period. This would help in restoring the lake's water level during the time of rainwater uses, and leads to water consumption balance, flood management and lake biodiversity conservation as well.

Suspended sediment deposition and sediment yields at Lake Peters, northeast Brooks Range, Alaska: Fluvial- and lake-based approaches	EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS												Lake-based studies can provide seasonal- to millennial-scale records of sediment yield to improve our understanding of catchment-scale sediment transfer and complement shorter fluvial-based sediment transport studies. In this study, sediment accumulation rates at 40 coring locations in Lake Peters, Brooks Range, Alaska, over ca. 42 years, calculated using fallout radionuclides and sediment density patterns, were spatially modelled based on distance from the primary inflow and lake water depth. We estimated mean interdecadal specific sediment yield (Mg km(-2) year(-1)) using the spatially modelled sediment accumulation rates and compared that result to fluvial-based sediment delivery for 2015-2016 open-channel seasons, as well as to yields reported for other Arctic catchments. Using the lake-based method, mean yield to Lake Peters between ca. 1973 and 2015 was 52 +/- 12 Mg km(-2) year(-1), which is comparable with fluvial-based modelling results of 33 (20-60) Mg km(-2) year(-1) in 2015 and 79 (50-140) Mg km(-2) year(-1) in 2016 (95% confidence intervals), respectively. Although 2016 was a year of above average sedimentation, the last extreme depositional event probably occurred between ca. 1970 and 1976 when a basal layer of fine sand was deposited in a broadly distributed, relatively thick and coarse bed, which we used for lake-wide correlation. The dual lacustrine-fluvial method approach permits study of within-lake and catchment-scale processes. Within Lake Peters, sedimentation patterns show decreasing fluxes down-lake, sediment bypassing near the primary inflow, the influence of secondary inflows and littoral redistribution, and a focusing effect in the deep proximal basin. At the watershed scale, sediment yield is largely driven by intense summer rainfall and strong seasonal hydroclimatic variability. This research informs paleo-environmental reconstruction and environmental system modelling in Arctic lake catchments.

An automated method for determining the trend of water-level change had been proposed in this study. Lake water footprints were first identified from the ICESat/GLAS GLA14 data product. Water level change was then determined from the footprints over lake water in each campaign. Trend of water-level changes was fitted with a line for each lake. Trends of water level changes from ICESat/GLAS matched well with gauge measurements in both Qinghai Lake and Nam Co. Our results showed that the trend of water-level change varied from -0.51 m/a to 0.62 m/a. Eighteen lakes showed a decreasing trend of water-level change and 38 lakes showed an increasing trend. Most lakes in Qinghai-Tibet Plateau showed an increasing trend which was probably caused by snow or glacier melts under climate warming. However, most lakes in the Yarlung Zangbu River basin showed a decreasing trend presumably resulting from intensified evaporation caused by climate warming and intensified western wind in the winter. Desertification and aggravated soil erosion in this region contributed to water level decrease. Lakes in northern Inner-Mongolia and Xinjiang and Northeast Plain of China showed decreasing trends with precipitation reduction and warming as the most probable reasons. Water consumption for agricultural use also contributed to water-level decrease in lakes of those regions. Lakes in East China Plain fluctuated presumably because most lakes were greatly affected by inflows of Yangtze River and human activities. Lakes in Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau also fluctuated. There were no obvious changes in climate warming or precipitation in this region.

The study site is a gravel pit lake in the Upper Rhine Graben near Ludwigshafen, Germany (800 x 250 m, mean depth 9 m, maximum depth 20 m). The governing mixing processes show patterns influenced by a strong density stratification. From weekly measured temperature profiles, we quantitatively estimated profiles of effective vertical transport coefficients K-z. In the stratified regions, K-z is at the level of heat conduction (similar to 1.4 center dot 10(-1) m(2)/s). Towards the lake bottom, we found a characteristic increase of K-z to values up to 10(-1) m(2)/s. Using a bottom-mounted 1,200 kHz-ADCP, we performed velocity measurements with a high vertical and temporal resolution (0.2 to 0.4 m and 5 min, respectively) of the horizontal currents. Using these horizontal flow data and stability profiles, Richardson numbers were analysed for a period of 5 weeks during summer stratification. The simultaneous measurements of currents and vertical diffusion coefficients allowed us to check a given parameterisation of K-z(Ri) and to discuss its applicability to the investigated system.																			1015-1621					MAR	2007	69	1					129	137		10.1007/s00027-006-0827-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-006-0827-4													WOS:000245007400013

The regression calculations of taxon-specific biomass with the corresponding signature pigments suggest that pigment analysis may be a useful tool for the monitoring of bloom-forming species, e.g. the dinoflagellate Peridinium gatunense Nygaard. The HPLC pigment analysis permitted the identification and quantification of chlorophyll degradation products, providing for the first time information about their composition in Lake Kinneret. Chlorophyllide a was the major detectable degradation product of chlorophyll a, varying between 1 and 9% of the chlorophyll a concentration. Other chlorophyll a derivatives appeared mostly in minor quantities. Pheophytin a was virtually lacking in all the samples Removal rates of pigments measured by sedimentation traps, indicated that the degradation of chlorophyll a via chlorophyllide a is a dynamic process that continues during the sedimentation of the phytoplankton particles.																			0142-7873					OCT	1996	18	10					1781	1796		10.1093/plankt/18.10.1781	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/18.10.1781													WOS:A1996VU40900002

The total salinity and chemistry of many groundwater samples are similar to sea-water composition. However, their stable isotopic compositions (delta O-18= -6.5 parts per thousand; delta H-2 = -35) are typical of mean winter rainfall, indicating that all the original sea water has been flushed out of the aquifer. Br/Cl mass ratios are approximately the same as sea water (3.57 x 10(-3)) indicating that NaCl evaporites (which have Br/Cl<10(-4)) are not a significant contributor to Cl in the groundwater. Similarly, very low abundances of Cl in aquifer minerals preclude rock weathering as a significant source of Cl. About 1.5 million tons of new salt is deposited in the Murray-Darling Basin each year by rainfall. The groundwater chemistry has evolved by a combination of atmospheric fallout of marine and continentally derived solutes and removal of water by evapo-transpiration over tens of thousands of years of relative aridity. Carbonate dissolution/precipitation, cation exchange and reconstitution of secondary clay minerals in the aquifers results in a groundwater chemistry that retains a 'sea-water-like' character.

The fake receives its major point-source loading, including pulp mill effluents, via the Pielisjoki River in the northeastern part of the lake, where the water is slightly eutrophic. The flow pattern was measured with three types of recording current meters, two of which were conventional mechanical meters and the third a new acoustic current profiler. The profiler was used in direct reading mode on a research vessel and also in self-contained mode on a float installed in the deep basin of the lake. The water-quality part of the model simulates oxygen, BOD, total phosphorus, AOX, and phytoplankton biomass. The three-dimensional model applied here simulates accurately the flow pattern of the water in Lake Pyhaselka. The results of this study made it possible to detect different flow patterns in the lake. The main load is clearly affected by the wind-induced pattern of flow.																			0018-8158					APR 12	1996	322	1-3					117	124		10.1007/BF00031815	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00031815													WOS:A1996UT84700019

A multi-proxy lake-sediment record of middle through late Holocene hydroclimate change in southern British Columbia, Canada	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Analysis of the oxygen isotopic composition (delta O-18) of sedimentary carbonates in Turquoise Lake (N50.83 degrees, W121.69 degrees, 807 m), southwestern British Columbia, provides information on middle through late Holocene hydroclimate variability at decadal-scale temporal resolution. Turquoise Lake water balance is strongly influenced by cold season precipitation and to a lesser extent by warm season evaporation. The lake water isotopic signature falls along the local evaporation line and is slightly enriched relative to local meteoric water, indicating that water losses from the lake occur principally through overflow and groundwater outseepage. An age model was developed using (210)pb, Cs-137, twelve C-14 measurements, and one tephra layer. 375 samples of authigenic carbonate (< 63 mu m-fraction), collected at 2-10 mm intervals over a 3 m long sediment sequence, were analyzed to produce the delta O-18 record. Multiple turbidite sequences that complicate the delta O-18 signal were identified via X-ray fluorescence, magnetic susceptibility, scanning electron microscopy, and powder x-ray diffraction analysis and were removed from the record. The Turquoise Lake delta O-18 record exhibits anomalously high values at similar to 7.6-6.5 ka, implying a dry middle Holocene and a transition to a wetter climate in the late-middle through late Holocene, with substantial variability on decadal and longer timescales. This result is consistent with other records from the Pacific Northwest, but the magnitude and timing of the transition from dry to wet conditions exhibited by the Turquoise delta O-18 record is unusual, with only the Castor Lake delta O-18 record exhibiting a somewhat similar pattern. Differences in hydroclimate signals from delta O-18 and other records in the Pacific Northwest point to complex intra-regional responses to Pacific ocean-atmosphere dynamics likely related to disparity in the orographic settings of the paleoclimate archives.

J	Zwisler, W; Selje, N; Simon, M				Zwisler, W; Selje, N; Simon, M			Seasonal patterns of the bacterioplankton community composition in a large mesotrophic lake	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												The composition of the bacterioplankton community in mesotrophic Lake Constance was studied from April 1996 to December 1997 by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with group specific oligonucleotide probes and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Between 10 and 59% of the DAPI-stained cells were detected as Bacteria with means of 38 +/- 12, 27 +/- 10 and 23 +/- 6% at 3, 20, and 50 m depth, respectively. In the euphotic zone at 3 m depth, beta-Proteobacteria always constituted highest proportions of the bacterial community detected by FISH and constituted 6 to 23% of the DAPI-stained cells with a mean of 12%. Proportions of bacteria belonging to the Cytophaga/Flavobacteria (CF) cluster and the alpha-Proteobacteria at this depth were 5.4 +/- 2.5 and 4.1 +/- 3.5%, respectively. Proportions of beta-Proteobacteiia decreased at 20 and 50 m, whereas that of alpha-Proteobacteria remained constant and that of the CF-cluster increased to 7.4%, such that they comprised similar proportions as beta-Proteobacteria at 50 m depth. gamma-Proteobacteria were always of minor importance and constituted only 2.2 +/- 1.3% of the DAPI cell counts. Cumulative proportions of all detected bacterial groups constituted 75% of the Bacteria counts at 3 m, 84% at 20 m and 99% at 50 m. The DGGE analysis of the bacterioplankton community showed seasonal and vertical variations of the banding patterns even though several bands occurred throughout the study period and at all depths. A cluster analysis revealed distinct bacterial clusters of the phytoplankton spring bloom and the later period and of epilimnetic and hypolimnetic waters. The sequence analysis of the excised bands indicated that all groups which were detected by FISH were represented in the patterns. Sequence similarities of the retrieved sequences to known isolates were <90 to 96.1%, and to other phylotypes as close as 99%. Phylotypes of beta-Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria of the typical banding patterns affiliated closely with recently described clusters of typical freshwater bacteria. In addition, we identified phylotypes of the Holophaga/Acidobacterium and Nitrospira phylum during the stratified period in samples from 50 m and during mixing from all 3 depths.																			0948-3055	1616-1564				APR 3	2003	31	3					211	225		10.3354/ame031211	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/ame031211													WOS:000182683700001

Marsh accretion rates were estimated mainly from Cs-137 profiles with further evidence from Am-241 because changes in both rate of deposition and nature of the accreting material precluded use of standard Pb-21(exeess) dating models. The Cs-137 profiles usually show peaks corresponding to atmospheric deposition from the 1963 fallout maximum and sometimes from the Chernobyl accident, although intervening enhanced Cs-137 activities derived from the nuclear reprocessing marine discharges of Sellafield and La Hague are clearly discernible. In all three marshes (Ritthem at the mouth of the estuary and Zuidgors and Waarde at 20 and 45 km upstream), a marked, near-coincident change in the rate of accumulation and in the grain size of material deposited occurred around 1980. This may be related to a combination of channel deepening and straightening operations undertaken in the mid-1970s and/or natural changes in winter wave climate.					; Wadsworth/ABB-5774-2020; Croudace, Ian/N-7018-2013	Croudace, Ian/0000-0003-1547-5650; Wadsworth, Richard/0000-0003-0593-8826; 													0013-936X	1520-5851				MAR 1	2002	36	5					854	861		10.1021/es0110527	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es0110527								11918007					WOS:000174136400021

Nevertheless, they are important for providing detailed information on long-term climate changes and temperature-precipitation relationships in the context of large-scale atmospheric dynamics. Here, we used chironomid and cladoceran fossil assemblages to reconstruct summer air-temperature and water-level changes, during the past 400 years, in a small lake located in Finnish Lapland. Temperatures remained persistently cold over the Little Ice Age (LIA), but increased in the 20th century. After a cooler phase in the 1970s, the climate rapidly warmed to the record-high temperatures of the most recent decades. The lake-level reconstruction suggested persistently wet conditions for the LIA, followed by a dry period between similar to 1910 and 1970 CE, when the lake apparently became almost dry. Since the 1980s, the lake level has returned to a similar position as during the IAA. The temperature development was consistent with earlier records, but a significant local feature was found in the lake-level reconstruction the LIA appears to have been continuously wet, without the generally depicted dry phase during the 18th and 19th centuries. Therefore, the results suggest local precipitation patterns and enforce the concept of spatially divergent LIA conditions.					; Płóciennik, Mateusz/R-1232-2018; Rantala, Marttiina/GWV-8049-2022	Nevalainen, Liisa/0000-0001-6837-8753; Rantala, Marttiina/0000-0002-3231-5926; Luoto, Tomi/0000-0001-6925-3688													0138-0338	2081-8262					2020	41	1					23	40		10.24425/ppr.2020.132568	http://dx.doi.org/10.24425/ppr.2020.132568													WOS:000524255400002
J	Gao, YP; Yang, WG; Guo, R; Jiang, LM				Gao, Yaping; Yang, Wenguang; Guo, Rui; Jiang, Liming			Remote Sensing Monitoring and Analysis of Jinwuco Lateral Moraine Landslide-Glacial Lake Outburst in Southeast Tibet	REMOTE SENSING												On 25 June 2020, a glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) occurred in Jinwuco, Nidou Zangbo, and southeast Tibet, causing catastrophic damage to multiple infrastructures such as roads, bridges, and farmlands in the surrounding and downstream areas. Due to the lack of long-term monitoring of glacial lake and glacier changes in the region and the surrounding surface, the spatial and temporal evolutionary characteristics and triggering factors of the disaster still need to be determined. Here, we combine multi-temporal optical remote sensing image interpretation, surface deformation monitoring with synthetic aperture radar (SAR)/InSAR, meteorological observation data, and corresponding soil moisture change information to systematically analyze the spatial and temporal evolution characteristics and triggering factors of this GLOF disaster. Optical images taken between 1987 and 2020 indicate that the glacial lake's initial area of 0.39 km(2) quickly grew to 0.56 km(2), then plummeted to 0.26 km(2) after the catastrophe. Meanwhile, we found obvious signs of slippage beside the lateral moraine at the junction of the glacier's terminus and the glacial lake. The pixel offset tracking (POT) results based on SAR images acquired before and after the disaster reveal that the western lateral moraine underwent a 40 m line of sight (LOS) deformation. The small baseline subset InSAR (SBAS-InSAR) results from 2017 to 2021 show that the cumulative deformation of the slope around the lateral moraine increased in the rainy season before the disaster, with a maximum cumulative deformation of -52 mm in 120 days and gradually stabilized after the disaster. However, there are three long-term deformation areas on the slope above it, showing an increasing trend after the disaster, with cumulative deformation exceeding -30 mm during the monitoring period. The lateral moraine collapse occurred in a warm climate with continuous and intense precipitation, and the low backscatter intensity prior to the slide suggests that the soil was very moist. Intense rainfall is thought to be the catalyst for lateral moraine collapse, whereas the lateral moraine falling into the glacier lake is the direct cause of the GLOF. This study shows that the joint active-passive remote sensing technique can accurately obtain the spatial and temporal evolution characteristics and triggering factors of GLOF. It is helpful to understand the GLOF event caused by the slide of lateral moraine more comprehensively, which is essential for further work related to glacial lake hazard assessment.					; Jiang, Liming/O-1776-2013	Gao, Yaping/0000-0001-9130-7355; Guo, Rui/0000-0002-4402-5010; Jiang, Liming/0000-0002-1127-9823; Yang, Wenguang/0009-0005-6250-5260														2072-4292				MAR	2023	15	6							1475	10.3390/rs15061475	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs15061475													WOS:000960224300001

High-frequency Data for Temperature and Oxygen Reveal the Potential for Stressful Conditions for Fish in a Southern New England Impoundment	NORTHEASTERN NATURALIST												Fishes have specific dissolved oxygen and water temperature requirements needed to promote optimal growth. Ongoing anthropogenic climate change will lead to increased water temperature and likely changes in dissolved oxygen concentrations that will affect fish populations in a variety of ways. This study uses high-frequency, automated sensor data from 2011-2015 to examine dissolved oxygen and water temperature in Lake Lillinonah, a hydroelectric impoundment in western Connecticut, to identify potentially stressful conditions for Esox lucius (Northern Pike [NP]) and Micropterus salmoides (Largemouth Bass [LMB]). We found that summer water temperature was nearly always in an optimal range for LMB growth, but was frequently in the stressful range for NP growth. In addition, in some years, Lake Lillinonah experienced consistent hypoxia, reducing the thermal refuge available for NP. Long-term data from Lake Lillinonah show an increase in mean July surface water temperature, and further temperature increases are expected as the climate continues to warm. This trend, coupled with a potential reduction in thermal refuge due to hypoxia, poses serious consequences for NP, given that current conditions frequently exceed documented optimal growth range for the species.																			1092-6194	1938-5307				JUL	2020	27	3					520	533		10.1656/045.027.0311	http://dx.doi.org/10.1656/045.027.0311													WOS:000576688300012
J	Balangoda, A				Balangoda, Anusha			nArtificial destratification effects on nitrogen and phosphorus dynamics in a eutrophic impoundment in the northern Great Plains	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												To determine the influence of artificial destratification on nutrient variations in a small eutrophic impoundment, field monitoring and laboratory analyses were conducted in three consecutive summers (2010, 2011, and 2012). The impact of aeration among sampling locations and across the water column of nutrient concentrations, including total and dissolved inorganic nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) and water temperature and dissolved oxygen (DO) was evaluated under aerated and non-aerated conditions. Aeration eliminated thermal stratification and DO concentrations of bottom waters increased. Nutrients including soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), total phosphorus (TP), and total nitrogen (TN) concentrations across the water column did not change significantly during aeration. Nevertheless, under aerated conditions, dissolved inorganic nutrients, TN, TP, and temperature were homogenously distributed throughout the water column as an effect of aeration. Results indicated that artificial destratification resuspended nutrients throughout the water column; however, it did not have a significant effect on nutrient concentrations in the water column, but SRP, TN, and TP concentrations did not reach to the recommended limit as needed by the North Dakota Department of Health requirements. Therefore, alternative aeration methods, for instance, hypolimnetic oxygenation or hypolimnetic aeration are recommended to control nutrient redistribution and/or further releases by existing aeration system.																			0167-6369	1573-2959				AUG	2016	188	8							469	10.1007/s10661-016-5444-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-016-5444-7								27418076					WOS:000381144300026

A 2000-yr reconstruction of air temperature in the Great Basin of the United States with specific reference to the Medieval Climatic Anomaly	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												A sediment core representing the past two millennia was recovered from Stella Lake in the Snake Range of the central Great Basin in Nevada. The core was analyzed for sub-fossil chironomids and sediment organic content. A quantitative reconstruction of mean July air temperature (MJAT) was developed using a regional training set and a chironomid-based WA-PLS inference model (r(jack)(2) = 0.55, RMSEP = 0.9 degrees C). The chironomid-based MJAT reconstruction suggests that the interval between AD 900 and AD 1300, corresponding to the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA), was characterized by MJAT elevated 1.0 degrees C above the subsequent Little Ice Age (LIA), but likely not as warm as recent conditions. Comparison of the Stella Lake temperature reconstruction to previously published paleoclimate records from this region indicates that the temperature fluctuations inferred to have occurred at Stella Lake between AD 900 and AD 1300 correspond to regional records documenting hydroclimate variability during the MCA interval. The Stella lake record provides evidence that elevated summer temperature contributed to the increased aridity that characterized the western United States during the MCA.

J	Matesa, S; Dominovic, I; Margus, M; Ciglenecki, I				Matesa, Sarah; Dominovic, Iva; Margus, Marija; Ciglenecki, Irena			Reduced sulfur species in a marine euxinic environment of Rogoznica Lake - Dragon Eye, Croatia	ACTA ADRIATICA												Rogoznica Lake (RL) - Dragon Eye is a unique, eutrophic marine lake on the eastern Adriatic coast. The lake exhibits seasonal variations between stratified and anoxic holomictic conditions. Under stratified conditions, RL shows typical euxinic features characterized by an euxinic hypolimnion (< 8 meters deep in recent years) with a relatively high total concentration of reduced sulfur species (RSStot). These species are mainly present in the form of sulfides, non-volatile RSS (RSSnv) attributed to elemental sulfur (S-0), and polysulfides (S-x(2-)). The concentration of RSStot, particularly the RSSnv and S-x(2-), varies seasonally depending on the physicochemical conditions in the water column, i.e. the position and stability of the chemocline and the entire water column, expressed by the Schmidt Stability Index (SSI), as well as the light intensity reaching this layer. In the summer months, when stratification is the strongest, the concentrations of the RSS(nv )in and below the chemocline are generally higher. In addition, the highest concentrations of S-x(2-) (up to 90 mu M of polysulfidic S-0) are detected during this period. This increase is related to a more intense microbial activity of phototrophic purple sulfur bacteria (PSB), which then reach maximum abundance due to the increased temperature and maximum light intensity. Typically, the highest concentrations of S-x(2-) are found below the chemocline. Long-term data indicate that the concentration of RSSnv at the chemocline and 1 m below it depends on the hydrostatic stability of the water column and shows periodic changes. This contrasts with the previously recorded trend of increasing RSStot in the anoxic monimolimnion.					ciglenecki, irena/N-8792-2013														0001-5113	1846-0453					2025	66	1							66	10.32582/aa.66.1.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.32582/aa.66.1.1													WOS:001442831700003

There was a significant negative correlation between salinity and oxygen concentration in the lagoon. Chlorophyll a concentration varied significantly during the daytime negatively depending on the oxygen concentration and temperature.

J	Vincent, WJ				Vincent, WJ			Nutrient partitioning in the upper Canning River, Western Australia, and implications for the control of cyanobacterial blooms using salinity	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING					International Symposium on Ecology and Engineering	NOV 10-12, 1997	FREMANTLE, AUSTRALIA	Univ Western Australia, Ctr Water Res, Univ Teknologi, Coastal & Offshore Engn Inst, Malaysia				The partitioning of N and P is examined between the submerged macrophytes, sediment and phytoplankton in a eutrophic freshwater impoundment on the Canning River, Western Australia. The importance of the macrophytes as a nutrient sink, and the effect of salinity increase on their growth were assessed. Summer cyanobacterial blooms in this system have led to a proposal to increase the salinity of this system to curtail or prevent the blooms. Uptake of N and P by Potamogeton crispus accounted for the major portion of the observed loss from the sediments. Luxury uptake of P, and N limitation, were indicated by tissue N:P ratios, with high biomass and tissue N and P concentrations indicating the capacity of this macrophyte to act as a nutrient sink in midsummer. Water column dissolved inorganic N (DIN) and filterable reactive phosphorous (FRP) was also reduced in midsummer. P. crispus showed significant reduction in growth at 8 ppt salinity, and Hydrilla verticillata at 6 ppt. Therefore, use of increased salinity to control freshwater cyanobacterial blooms is likely to reduce nutrient uptake by macrophytes, and may cause a change to phytoplankton dominance.

Targeting Aggregations of Telemetered Lake Trout to Increase Gillnetting Suppression Efficacy	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Conserving Yellowstone Cutthroat Trout Oncorhynchus clarkii bouvieri by suppressing invasive Lake Trout Salvelinus namaycush in Yellowstone Lake is a high priority for Yellowstone National Park resource managers. Here, we tested whether targeting telemetered Lake Trout could increase the efficacy of Lake Trout suppression by gill netting. Mobile acoustic tracking surveys were performed to identify aggregations of tagged Lake Trout in summer (June-August) 2017. Lake Trout aggregations were relayed daily to suppression crews by phone, radio, or text and a printed map. Suppression crews set 30 large-mesh gill nets targeting telemetered Lake Trout aggregations (target treatment) and 124 large-mesh gill nets not targeting telemetered aggregations (nontarget treatment). Mean log(e)(CPUE) was higher for the target treatment (0.37; 95% credible interval [CRI] = 0.08-0.65) than for the nontarget treatment (-0.37; 95% CRI = -0.51 to -0.21). Mean of the target treatment was higher than the mean of the nontarget treatment for over 99% of the 1,000 draws from the joint posterior distribution. Because of telemetry costs, mean CPUE per US$10,000 spent was similar between the target treatment (0.20; 95% CRI = 0.15-0.26) and the nontarget treatment (0.15; 95% CRI = 0.13-0.17). Telemetry is an effective strategy for improving Lake Trout CPUE, which corresponds to an increased efficiency in the Lake Trout suppression program.

National Weather Service Data Needs for Short-Term Forecasts and the Role of Unmanned Aircraft in Filling the Gap Results from a Nationwide Survey	BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY												Inclusion of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) into the weather surveillance network has the potential to improve short-term (<1 day) weather forecasts through direct integration of UAS-collected data into the forecast process and assimilation into numerical weather prediction models. However, one of the primary means by which the value of any new sensing platform can be assessed is through consultation with principal stakeholders. National Weather Service (NWS) forecasters are principal stakeholders responsible for the issuance of short-term forecasts. The purpose of the work presented here is to use results from a survey of 630 NWS forecasters to assess critical data gaps that impact short-term forecast accuracy and explore the potential role of UAS in filling these gaps. NWS forecasters view winter precipitation, icing, flood, lake-effect/lake-enhanced snow, turbulence, and waves as the phenomena principally impacted by data gaps. Of the 10 high-priority weather-related characteristics that need to be observed to fill critical data gaps, 7 are either measures of precipitation or related to precipitation-producing phenomena. The three most important UAS capabilities/characteristics required for useful data for weather forecasting are real-time or near-real-time data, the ability to integrate UAS data with additional data gathered by other systems, and UASs equipped with cameras to verify forecasts and monitor weather. Of the three operation modes offered for forecasters to consider, targeted surveillance is considered to be the most important compared to fixed site profiling or transects between fixed sites.

Since the 1980s, numerous lakes in the Jiziwan (JZW) of the Yellow River have shrunk significantly, yet their interannual dynamics and driving mechanisms remain unexplored. Using Landsat data, this study analyzed spatiotemporal dynamics of seasonal and permanent lakes (>0.01 km2) over 39 years, considering elevation zones and watershed divisions, and assessed their sensitivity to climatic shifts and anthropogenic interventions. New hydrological insights for the region: The results indicated that the area of seasonal lakes in JZW slightly increased from 1986 to 2024, whereas the area of permanent lakes declined significantly, with the most pronounced shrinkage in middle- to high-altitude regions (1200 <= DEM<1300 m and DEM >= 1300 m). These regions accounted for a larger proportion of the total lake area in JZW, and their lake areas were more strongly correlated with annual temperature, land surface temperature, annual precipitation, and summer evaporation. Watershed analysis revealed seasonal lakes expanded across all watersheds, while permanent lakes in the Endorheic Region (ER) shrank continuously. Human activities were primary drivers of lake shrinkage in the ER, contributing 93.03 % to the reduction in permanent lakes, while seasonal lakes in the ER were more sensitive to climate change. This study clarifies the spatiotemporal variation patterns and driving forces of lakes in JZW, providing a scientific basis for understanding the mechanisms of seasonal lake changes and supporting lake function maintenance.																				2214-5818				OCT	2025	61								102752	10.1016/j.ejrh.2025.102752	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrh.2025.102752		SEP 2025											WOS:001568909700003

The synthesized adsorbent was characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffractometry, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and field emission scanning electron microscopy. The developed adsorbent was used for the removal and simultaneous preconcentration of As(III) and As(V) from environmental waters prior to ICP-MS analysis. Fe3O4@SiO2/GO provided high adsorption capacities, i.e., 7.51 and 11.46 mg g(-1) for As(III) and As(V), respectively, at pH 4.0. Adsorption isotherm, kinetic, and thermodynamic were investigated for As(III) and As(V) adsorption. Preconcentration of As(III) and As(V) were studied using magnetic solid-phase extraction (MSPE) method at pH 9.0 as the adsorbent showed selective adsorption for As(III) only in pH range 7-10. MSPE using Fe3O4@SiO2/GO was developed with good linearities (0.05-2.0 ng mL(-1)) and high coefficient of determination (R-2 = 0.9992 and 0.9985) for As(III) and As(V), respectively. The limits of detection (LODs) (3x SD/m, n = 3) obtained were 7.9 pg mL(-1) for As(III) and 28.0 pg mL(-1) for As(V). The LOD obtained is 357-1265x lower than the WHO maximum permissible limit of 10.0 ng mL(-1). The developed MSPE method showed good relative recoveries (72.55-109.71 %) and good RSDs (0.1-4.3 %, n = 3) for spring water, lake, river, and tap water samples. The new-generation adsorbent can be used for the removal and simultaneous preconcentration of As(III) and As(V) from water samples successfully. The adsorbent removal for As(III) is better than As(V).					; Sanagi, Mohd/A-1370-2013; Ali, Prof. Imran/F-7710-2010; Ali, Imran/F-7710-2010; Rashidi Nodeh, Hamid/AAA-8935-2019	Rashidi Nodeh, Hamid/0000-0002-7920-289X; Wan Ibrahim, Wan Aini/0000-0002-0991-770X; Ali, Imran/0000-0001-6511-8374; 													0944-1344	1614-7499				MAY	2016	23	10					9759	9773		10.1007/s11356-016-6137-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-016-6137-z								26850098					WOS:000376421400048
J	GACHTER, R; MARES, A				GACHTER, R; MARES, A			DOES SETTLING SESTON RELEASE SOLUBLE REACTIVE PHOSPHORUS IN THE HYPOLIMNION OF LAKES	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Organic material collected with sediment traps at depths of 20, 40 and 60 m in mesotrophic, P-limited Lake Lucerne was decomposed aerobically at a rate of about 0.01 day-1 at 6.degree. C. This material is not a source, but rather a sink, for soluble reactive P (SRP). As a consequence, during stratification, in the upper part of the hypolimnion concentrations of O2 and SRP decrease simultaneously, and the ratio POC:PP (particulate organic Ca: particulate P) decreases significantly with increasing sampling depth and hence with increasing age of the seston. Once deposited at the aerobic sediment surface, the particulate matter continues to accumulate SRP. Since settling particles and the aerobic sediment surface both act as sinks for SRP, anaerobic subsurface sediments are the only possible source for the SRP accumulating in the hypolimnion during summer stagnation. The aerobic sediment layer may however become an apparent source for SRP if the supply from deeper anoxic sediments exceeds its biological-chemical sorption capacity. Based on these observations and on additional information from the literature it is hypothesized that in P limited lakes decomposing organisms do not release, but rather take up, SRP while mineralizing P poor organic material.

Climate variability over the last two millennia in the North American Monsoon region, recorded in laminated lake sediments from Laguna de Juanacatlan, Mexico	HOLOCENE												High-resolution titanium (Ti) data obtained using an ITRAX XRF core scanner from a laminated sediment core from the Laguna de Juanacatlan, western central Mexico yield a unique high-resolution record of runoff (precipitation) change for the last 2000 years. In the absence of reliable, long-term meteorological records, comparison of the Ti data with information from the rich Spanish colonial period archives and the post-Independence period, confirms that Ti is a proxy for runoff. This interpretation is supported by comparison with other high-resolution archives from the surrounding region, primarily tree rings and other lake sediment sequences. The Juanacatlan Ti record is therefore a proxy for summer, monsoonal rainfall. The record provides new evidence from the Pacific margin of tropical North America of the occurrence of dry conditions through much of the Classic period (c. AD 300-900), and wetter conditions during the later Medieval period (c. AD 1200-1350). The period commonly known as the 'Little Ice Age' (LIA) shows considerable variability, with dry conditions in the early part (c. AD 1400-1600) and wetter conditions, punctuated by multiyear droughts through the eighteenth century. A notable feature of the record is the apparent decoupling of lacustrine sedimentation from the climate since the mid-twentieth century, possibly resulting from anthropogenic disturbance. Preliminary interpretations of the Ti record indicate that patterns are consistent with changes in monsoon strength associated with ENSO and solar forcing over the last two millennia.

The most prevalent parasites were the nematode Cosmocerella haberi (Steiner) Baker and Adamson (23%) and the protozoan Opalina sp. Purkinje and Valentin (47%). The trematode, Clinostomum attenuatum Cort, had a prevalence of 2%, and the other nematode, Rhabdias sp. Stiles and Hassall, had a prevalence of 5%. Seven females and seven males were infected with C. haberi. The prevalence and intensity of C. haberi were correlated positively with host size (wet weight and snout-vent length). There was no statistically significant difference between gender and intensity of C. haberi infection. Fourteen females and 14 males were infected with Opalina sp. The prevalence of Opalina sp was correlated negatively with host size. Both C. haberi and Opalina so. have been reported previously from II. cinerea. The green treefrog represents a new host record for C. attenuatum and Rhabdias sp.																			1525-2647	1938-2952				JUL	2000	67	2					255	258																WOS:000088415900017

The area of the lake was small and the water level low in the late part of the last glacial period. Thereafter, the lake became larger and the water level high because of meltwater and rainfall. This hydrological environment continued until 4000 yr B.P., at about which time the level of the lake fell sharply and the lake area shrank. After a short period of low level and aridity, the water level increased markedly but did not reach the previous high level. After the large water inflow for a short period, the climate became again arid at about 3500 yr B.P. The change in this interval is closely related to global change. Statistical analyses of the datasets of the grain particle components of bottom sediments preserved in an aquatic condition over the past 13,000 yr show that most datasets for grain size and chemical parameters had a common period of 2000-2200 yr during this interval.																			0012-821X	1385-013X				OCT	1995	135	1-4					31	39		10.1016/0012-821X(95)00136-Z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0012-821X(95)00136-Z													WOS:A1995TC78600003
J	Ashton, GD				Ashton, George D.			River and lake ice thickening, thinning, and snow ice formation	COLD REGIONS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												There is probably no more important characteristic of river and lake ice than the thickness. This paper consists of three parts: In Part I the thickening of ice via conduction is analyzed and tested against an extensive data set assembled by Bilello (1961-1996) that included weekly measurements of ice thickness and snow on the ice for a number of sites in Alaska and Canada. It is shown that the largest variations from year to year at a given site are associated with the thickness of the snow on the ice, and secondarily by variations in the coldness of the winter period of thickening. If no snow ice forms, quite good agreement with a simple thickening algorithm is achieved. This leads to Part 11 where the formation of snow ice is analyzed but the analysis is constrained by the fact that sometimes, even though the weight of the snow is enough to submerge the solid ice cover, there seems to be no snow ice formation. Differences between the formation of snow ice on river and lake ice covers are examined. For river ice covers, the water from below cannot always find a path to the top of the ice cover. Finally, in Part III the thinning of river ice covers is analyzed using a simple algorithm based on solar radiation calculations and sensible and latent heat transfers from the air to the ice. Good agreement is obtained with the extensive data set of Bilello (1980). Implications for practical calculations of thickness are discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Source Apportionment of Particulate Matter in Urban Snowpack Using End-Member Mixing Analysis and Positive Matrix Factorization Model	SUSTAINABILITY												The aim of this study was to identify particulate matter (PM) sources and to evaluate their contributions to PM in the snowpack of three East Siberian cities. That was the first time when the PM accumulated in the snowpack during the winter was used as the object for source apportionment study in urban environment. The use of long-term integrated PM samples allowed to exclude the influence of short-term weather conditions and anthropogenic activities on PM chemistry. To ascertain the real number of PM sources and their contributions to air pollution the results of source apportionment using positive matrix factorization model (PMF) were for the first time compared to the results obtained using end-member mixing analysis (EMMA). It was found that Si, Fe and Ca were the tracers of aluminosilicates, non-exhaust traffic emissions and concrete deterioration respectively. Aluminum was found to be the tracer of both fossil fuel combustion and aluminum production. The results obtained using EMMA were in good agreement with those obtained using PMF. However, in some cases, the non-point sources identified using PMF were the combinations of two single non-point sources identified using EMMA, whereas the non-point sources identified using EMMA were split by PMF into two single non-point sources. The point sources were clearly identified using both techniques.

Intelligent data mining of vertical profiler readings to predict manganese concentrations in water reservoirs	JOURNAL OF WATER SUPPLY RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY-AQUA												Continuously monitoring and managing manganese (Mn) concentrations in drinking water supply reservoirs are paramount for water suppliers since high soluble Mn loads lead to discoloration of potable water. Despite the Mn level currently being manually sampled throughout the year, in subtropical monomictic lakes such as Hinze Dam, critical Mn concentrations in the epilimnion, where the water is drawn, are typically recorded only during winter lake circulation. A vertical profiling system (VPS) installed can continuously collect physical parameters that determine the transport process of Mn in the lake. Therefore, a long-term historical database gives opportunities for the development of a Mn prediction model. In the present study, VPS and sampling data were collected and analysed, and prediction models applying nonlinear regression techniques and data-driven equations were developed and assessed. They were able to accurately forecast future Mn concentrations from 1 to 7 days ahead and in particular the critical peak concentrations in the epilimnion during the lake destratification. The model also displays the probabilities of the Mn to exceed certain key-thresholds, thus assisting operators in Mn treatment decision-making. Such a tool is very beneficial for the water supplier, since costly and time-consuming water samplings for monitoring Mn concentrations can be avoided, thus relying only on the real time VPS-based model outputs.

From the genera that have been assigned unambiguously to one of the three subfamilies, a clear biogeographic pattern emerges that highlights a wide geographic separation of Bellamyinae from Viviparinae and Lioplacinae. Here we study Rivularia Heude, 1890, a genus previously assigned to Bellamyinae and largely restricted to the Hunan Province of China. We find that, although the taxon falls within the geographic range of Bellamyinae, comparative anatomical and genetic data reveal that it is a viviparine, tentatively the sister group of European Viviparus. Anatomical support includes the morphology of the radula and salivary glands, the presence of the testis in close association with the digestive gland in the viscera, rather than in the pallial cavity (Bellamyinae) and in females, the occurrence of the albumen gland and capsule gland ventral rather than posterior to the brood pouch, and proximal, rather than distal, to the last U-turn in the female reproductive tract. Greater differences are found when compared with Lioplacinae. Our finding represents the first record of natural co-occurrence of Viviparinae and Bellamyinae. Vicariance is the most likely cause for the strongly disjunct occurrence of Viviparinae in the Palearctic.					; Stelbrink, Björn/Y-5023-2019; Van Bocxlaer, Bert/N-1965-2016	Strong, Ellen/0000-0001-7181-4114; Stelbrink, Bjorn/0000-0002-7471-4992													0024-4082	1096-3642				JAN	2018	182	1					1	23		10.1093/zoolinnean/zlx014	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/zoolinnean/zlx014													WOS:000418726600001

Eurasian watermilfoil has the ability to alter the structure and function of the ecosystems that it invades. Eurasian watermilfoil was first surveyed in the Clark Fork River, MT in 2008, alongside the native northern watermilfoil (Myriophyllum sibiricum). Three reservoirs (Cabinet Gorge, Noxon Rapids and Thompson Falls) on the lower Clark Fork River had entire lake surveys conducted using the point intercept method. Morphological data from these surveys showed that only Eurasian watermilfoil and northern watermilfoil were present during the time of the surveys in 2008. The results of the morphological identification were supported by molecular identification at three different laboratories. In 2015, a genetic survey of watermilfoil species was conducted on the Noxon Rapids Reservoir and found that hybrid watermilfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum x sibiricum) was present. This hybridization event poses a number of issues for aquatic plant management. Hybrid watermilfoil is much more difficult to identify morphologically than its parent types. The hybrid is also more invasive and may be differentially susceptible to some herbicides than the parental type Eurasian watermilfoil.					; Schmid, Samuel/KZU-6076-2024	Schmid, Samuel/0000-0001-9523-5459; 													0270-5060	2156-6941				JAN 1	2021	36	1								10.1080/02705060.2021.1908919	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.2021.1908919													WOS:000647659400001

Increased Dust Deposition in New Zealand Related to Twentieth Century Australian Land Use	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Mineral aerosols (dust) generated in the dryland regions of Australia have the potential to reach New Zealand through atmospheric transport. Although a large portion of dust in New Zealand originates in Australia, little is known about how dust deposition has varied over time in New Zealand or what may have caused this variation. We used geochemical dust proxies to examine the recent history of dust deposition to two alpine lakes in Kahurangi National Park, South Island, New Zealand. Geochemical indicators suggest that dust deposition began to increase around 1900, with the greatest deposition rates occurring from similar to 1920 to similar to 1990. In subsequent decades, dust deposition rates to New Zealand lakes appear to have declined. This rise and fall of dust deposition recorded in New Zealand lakes is consistent with dust records from the Antarctic Ice Sheet, Eastern Australia, and incidents of low visibility due to dust events recorded at Australian climate stations. The dust deposition rate over time also follows the temporal pattern of land use in south and central Australia over the time scale of the twentieth century suggesting a causal linkage. It is possible, and perhaps likely, that drought cycles also affected both emissions and transport pathways but over shorter time periods this was difficult to discern at the temporal resolution of these lake sediment cores. The increase in dust deposition to the high-elevation regions of New Zealand likely has implications for the biogeochemistry of alpine lakes in the Tasman Mountains.					; Brahney, Janice/H-3591-2019; Neff, JC/A-1211-2012; Baisden, W.

Bacterial density, cell size, and empirical conversion factors for bacterial productivity were highly variable at both sites and greater at the coastal site (P < 0.01). Bacterial productivity at the coastal site was 25-50 times higher than at the offshore site. Bacterivory was estimated in situ by fluorescently labeled native bacteria. Per-cell grazing rate and filtering rate for each taxon were routinely determined. Heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNAN) were the most important protistan bacterivores at the offshore site, while HNAN and ciliates were similarly dominant bacterivores at the coastal site. Mixotrophic bacterivory was important only at the offshore site where Dinobryon was the dominant bacterivore. Bacterial carbon flux through protists was higher at the coastal site by an order of magnitude. Offshore protists grazed virtually the entire bacterial production, while coastal protists usually grazed less than half of the bacterial production. These results suggest that coastal and offshore sites differed fundamentally in the significance of protists to carbon flux through the microbial loop to higher trophic levels.																			0706-652X					APR	1997	54	4					788	799		10.1139/cjfas-54-4-788	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-54-4-788													WOS:A1997XA82600006

Large mammal tracks in 1.8-million-year-old volcanic ash (Tuff IF, Bed I) at Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania	ICHNOS-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PLANT AND ANIMAL TRACES												Large animal tracks, unequivocally attributable to terrestrial mammals, are reported for the first time in sediment from uppermost Bed I (Tuff I-F; similar to 1.803 million years ago) at Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania. One track in particular (attributed to the ichnogenus Pecoripeda) retains an exceptional level of detail, demonstrating the excellent trackway-preserving potential of the volcanic ash fall (tuff) layers at this important hominin archaeological locality. Olduvai Gorge is renowned for its abundant Plio-Pleistocene (zoo)archaeological discoveries and fossiliferous deposits vis-a-vis studies of human evolution. Fossil trackways, and trace fossils more widely, provide an important additional tool for characterizing ancient ecosystems, which remain underexplored at Olduvai. Considered together with fossil hominin remains, information derived from coeval fossil animal tracks provides additional insight into our ancestors' behaviour and their interactions with the surrounding palaeoenvironment. A range of large herbivore tracks indicates the availability of nearby resources (i.e., freshwater, vegetation preferred by grazers/browsers). These newly-discovered tracks are of archaeological and palaeontological significance because they highlight the potential for future discovery of animal or hominin tracks and trackways preserved in tuff at Olduvai and in other archaeological localities.

A total of 2163 water bodies, having a total area of 1.09 x 10(7) m(2), were identified in the study area using unsupervised classification and image interpretation. Several shape metrics (area, perimeter, circularity index, elongation index, orientation of major axis, and curvature of lake shoreline) were determined for lakes from the imagery, and bathymetric profiles of lake bottoms were derived using ground-penetrating radar. The results highlighted significant morphometric differences between lakes larger than 5000 m(2) among three subregions: the Chumaerhe High Plain (CUP), the Hoh Xil Hill region (HXR), and the Beluhe Basin region (BBR). The lakes in CI-IP usually have a more regular outline and smooth lake bottoms, while the lakes in HXR often have the greatest depths and the most complex shorelines. The most elongated and largest lakes were typically in BBR. Other than a minor NE-SE peak in HXR and BBR, the major axis orientation for lakes in the three subregions is mostly ENE-WSW. The differences in lake morphology between the three subregions are associated with differences in ground-ice content, local relief, and topography. The dominant factors controlling the development of orientated thermokarst lakes in the region are the prevailing summer wind direction and solar insolation.					luo, jing/JEP-0699-2023														1523-0430	1938-4246				NOV	2014	46	4			SI		963	974		10.1657/1938-4246-46.4.963	http://dx.doi.org/10.1657/1938-4246-46.4.963													WOS:000346219500022

While GDGT-based proxies have been applied to a number of lake environments globally, little is known about the distribution of GDGTs on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. We have investigated the isoprenoid GDGTs (iGDGTs) and branched GDGTs (bGDGTs) in Lake Qinghai sediments and the surrounding surface soil in order to examine their potential use as paleoclimate proxies on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The results show that (i) the values of the iGDGT/bGDGT ratio for surrounding soil were at the higher end among globally distributed soils and consequently BIT values (avg. 0.71) at the lower end, (ii) the TEX86 values decreased while the MBT and CBT values increased along an onshore soil-nearshore sediment-offshore sediment transect, (iii) the TEX86 values for the offshore sediments were almost identical and their inferred temperatures were close to mean summer surface water temperature and (iv) the bGDGT-inferred mean annual air temperature (MAAT) and pH for soil were consistent with measured MAAT and pH. However, the CBT-inferred pH for offshore sediments seemed inconsistent with the pH of lake water or sediment. Our results suggest that (i) the higher pH may be an important factor leading to the higher iGDGT/bGDGT values (and lower BIT values) in surrounding surface soil, (ii) both iGDGTs and bGDGTs may originate from terrestrial input and in situ production for this saline lake, especially for nearshore sediments. However, for offshore sediments, terrestrial iGDGT input seems minor, and TEX86 may be useful for paleoclimate studies of Lake Qinghai. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The slope units are situated along water courses, lakes and wetlands in order to elucidate the transfer of sediment to the aquatic environment. This transfer is often related to the formation and development of rills. To study the physical factors and human impacts that influence the incidence of rilling, the slope units have been deliberately chosen from areas with an expected erosion risk. The results demonstrate that substantial amounts of sediment, up to 3600 t km(-2), can be delivered to the aquatic environment from adjacent slopes. The results confirm that Long steep smooth slopes are especially prone to erosion. These physical factors are in Denmark partly influenced by land management and tillage. It is also demonstrated that the common practice of using winter sown crops to inhibit nitrate loss, can cause an increased delivery of sediment and associated nutrients. The related smoothing of the seedbed and the common practice of tillage up and down the slopes also increase the sediment delivery. It is confirmed that rilling is partly a response to human impact.

A five-year summary of water quality, zooplankton, and fishes in the open waters of Lake Erie's Presque Isle Bay	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Long-term monitoring of freshwater ecosystems is critical to understanding how these systems change over time. Our efforts have focused on the open waters of Lake Erie's Presque Isle Bay (PIB) in Erie, Pennsylvania. The bay serves as an important economic and recreational body of water to the Erie region. Over the last several decades, the bay has undergone numerous water-quality changes and has been well studied, but no researchers have monitored PIB on a continuous basis. In the summer of 2017, a monthly monitoring program was started that focuses on detecting changes in water-quality as well as zooplankton and fish communities. Monitoring is focused from June through November each year. Sampling occurs each month in the same location aboard the RV Environaut. Here, data collected from 2017 through 2021 are presented to document changes in water quality, zooplankton, and fishes in the open waters of PIB. Analyses of variance (ANOVA) revealed a strong seasonal pattern and among-year variation in many water quality and fish parameters. Across the five-year period, linear regression revealed significant decreases in pH, Z1% (the depth at which 1% of the light from the surface remains), and juvenile copepod abundance that we link to changes in water level. Our data contribute to the growing body of literature that highlights the importance of studying the near-shore embayments and coastal wetlands in Lake Erie. These shallow areas often respond to environmental perturbations faster or differently than the open waters of the lake.

J	Röder, E; Matschullat, J; Rau, A; Lau, MP				Roeder, Eric; Matschullat, Joerg; Rau, Alice; Lau, Maximilian Peter			Carbon dioxide emissions from temperate reservoirs and pit lakes of different trophic states	INLAND WATERS												The abundance of constructed inland waters, such as artificial ponds and reservoirs, has increased over the last decades. Compared to natural lakes, reservoirs and retention basins can exhibit a higher accumulation of organic carbon and a higher emission of greenhouse gases. The magnitude and dynamics of related emission fluxes are important to understand the role of inland waters in the global carbon cycle. However, origin and use of artificial waterbodies are diverse, and it is unclear whether current gas flux estimates adequately represent all important types and conditions of artificial inland waters. This study compares drivers of CO2 and CH4 emissions from 2 types of temperate artificial waters widespread in central Europe: reservoirs and artificial lakes in former open-pit lignite mines (pit lakes). We measured CO2 exchange at the water surface, calculated surface water CO2 from long-term dissolved inorganic carbon and pH data, and measured CO2 and CH4 concentrations throughout the water column. We found that an older, eutrophic pit lake showed seasonal variations in CO2 fluxes including uptake during summer and release during turnover, similar to 3 studied freshwater reservoirs. By contrast, reacidification and repeated addition of carbonate (liming) led to sustained CO2 supersaturation in a young, oligotrophic pit lake throughout the year, potentially making it a steady source of CO2 to the atmosphere. This finding implies that on an annual level, pH regulation and lake maturity largely determine whether pit lakes act as sources of CO2 (young, slightly acidic) or sinks of CO2 (older, neutral pH).

Sedimentation is mainly of minerogenic origin. The organic matter quantity (TOC%) as well as its quality (hydrogen (HI) and oxygen (OI) indices) both indicate the progressive onset and subsequent stabilization of vegetation cover in the catchment from 9950 to 5550 cal. BP. During this phase, the pedogenic process of carbonate dissolution is marked by a decrease in the calcium content in the sediment record. Between 7850 and 5550 cal. BP, very low manganese concentrations suggest anoxic conditions in the bottom-water of Lake Anterne. These are caused by a relatively high organic matter (terrestrial and lacustrine) content, a low flood frequency and longer summer stratification triggered by warmer conditions. From 5550 cal. BP, a decrease in TOC, stabilization of HI and higher sedimentation rates together reflect increased erosion rates of leptosols and developed soils, probably due to a colder and wetter climate. Then, three periods of important soil destabilization are marked by an increased frequency and thickness of flood deposits during the Bronze Age and by increases in topsoil erosion relative to leptosols (HI increases) during the late Iron Age/Roman period and the Medieval periods. These periods are also characterized by higher sedimentation rates. According to palynological data, human impact (deforestation and/or pasturing activity) probably triggered these periods of increased soil erosion.

J	Vis, C; Cattaneo, A; Hudon, C				Vis, Chantal; Cattaneo, Antonella; Hudon, Christiane			Shift from chlorophytes to cyanobacteria in benthic macroalgae along a gradient of nitrate depletion	JOURNAL OF PHYCOLOGY												A survey of the spatial distribution of benthic macroalgae in a fluvial lake of the St. Lawrence River (Lake Saint-Pierre, Quebec, Canada) revealed a shift in composition from chlorophytes to cyanobacteria along the flow path of nutrient-rich waters originating from tributaries draining farmlands. The link between this shift and changes in water quality characteristics was investigated by sampling at 10 sites along a 15 km transect. Conductivity, current, light extinction, total phosphorus (TP; > 25 mu g P . L-1), and ammonium (8-21 mu g N . L-1) remained fairly constant along the transect in contrast to nitrate concentrations, which fell sharply. Filamentous and colonial chlorophytes [Cladophora sp. and Hydrodictyon reticulatum (L.) Bory] dominated in the first 5 km where nitrate concentrations were > 240 mu g N . L-1. A mixed assemblage of chlorophytes and cyanobacteria characterized a 1 km transition zone where nitrate decreased to 40-80 mu g N . L-1. In the last section of the transect, nitrate concentrations dropped below 10 mu g N . L-1, and cyanobacteria (benthic filamentous mats of Lyngbya wollei Farl. ex Gomont and epiphytic colonies of Gloeotrichia) dominated the benthic community. The predominance of nitrogen-fixing, potentially toxic cyanobacteria likely resulted from excessive nutrient loads and may affect nutrient and trophic dynamics in the river.

In one of the lakes, Lake Geerplas, both the internal and external phosphorus load to the lake was reduced. Water quality parameters have been monitored six years after the measures were taken, in both Lake Geerplas and in one of the other Langeraar lakes. Water quality improved in Lake Geerplas during four years, indicated by decreased phosphorus concentrations and turbidity. At the end of the third fourth summer, phosphorus concentrations increased rapidly, presumably due to excessive phosphorus release from the lake sediment. Phytoplankton biomass and phytoplankton composition changed as well. In the sixth year phosphorus concentrations decreased slowly without any additional measures taken. Chlorophyll-a concentrations and turbidity are at the same level now as shortly after the measures were taken. At this moment, the effects of the measures are evaluated and additional measures are considered. Though the changes in water quality variables during the years are clearly related, the driving forces are not yet identified. (C) 1998 IAWQ.

Evidence for phosphorus, nitrogen, and iron colimitation of phytoplankton communities in Lake Erie	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Three nutrient enrichment experiments involving the addition and removal of iron (Fe) alone, as well as in combination with phosphorus (P) and/or nitrogen (N), were conducted in the offshore and nearshore waters of the eastern basin of Lake Erie. Lake Erie phytoplankton are at times colimited by P, N, and Fe. This was most clearly demonstrated in the offshore, strongly stratified waters, where the Fe concentration was below detection (DL = 2.0 nmol L-1), and nutrient limitation indicators (APA, P debt, C: P, N: P, N debt, and C: N) indicated strong P and moderate N limitation. Enrichment with Fe alone did not result in a significant increase in phytoplankton biomass, but the combined addition of Fe, P, and N yielded greater biomass increases than the addition of P and N alone. Phosphorus and Fe were both required to stimulate biomass increases. Nutrient limitation indicators and dissolved nutrient measurements showed that P and Fe additions facilitated the uptake of nitrate (NO3-), which is the most abundant source of N because of the low ammonium (NH4+) concentrations in Lake Erie. Our results support a colimitation hypothesis wherein the addition of Fe reduces N limitation by allowing the phytoplankton communities to use NO3-, take up more P, and become more strongly P limited. Phytoplankton communities of the eastern basin of Lake Erie and numerous other lakes experience colimitation by P, N, and Fe during the summer period of thermal stratification.

The volume of the ice and rock fall from Mt. Hualcan was estimated to be about 500,000 m(3) and the detachment zone was identified between 5,450 and 5,600 m a.s.l. Basic landforms and processes (e.g. stream erosion, accumulation) were characterized by field investigation (2010 and 2011) as well as the rate of deglaciation using remotely sensed data (1948, 1962, 1970 and 2010). Two relatively independent parts of the Chucchun Valley were identified from the point of view of sediment flux: uppermost part of the catchment (4,192-3,575 m a.s.l.), where even fine-grained sediments were laid down, and the lower reaches up to the confluence (3,191-2,640 m a.s.l.), where valley bottom sediments were mobilised by the increased discharge. The comparison of field data and potential for erosion or sedimentation derived from the HEC-RAS model mostly showed conformity and discrepancy occurred in the valley segments where an extreme discharge during the 2010 GLOF laid down sediments after the gradient of the flow diminished. The rate of deglaciation is also described using historical remotely sensed data and unpublished reports and was set as 1,040 m in the last 62 years. We focused our attention also on the uppermost part of the catchment and applied a modified quantitative method for GLOF hazard evaluation-high topographical susceptibility for an icefall into the lake was calculated (0.92).

J	PUTMAN, JH; PIERCE, CL; DAY, DM				PUTMAN, JH; PIERCE, CL; DAY, DM			RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES AND SIZE-SPECIFIC GROWTH-RATES OF ILLINOIS STREAM FISHES	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												We quantified size-specific growth of small and large rock bass Ambloplites rupestris, bluegill Lepomis macrochirus, largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides, smallmouth bass M. dolomieu, and channel catfish Ictalurus punctatus from Illinois streams. Growth rates for each species fell within ranges previously reported for lakes and rivers in Illinois and adjacent states, although growth rates in our study averaged slightly lower. Intraspecific growth rate comparisons of small and large individuals were not significantly correlated for bluegill and rock bass. This suggests ontogenetic shifts occurred in diet or habitat use of these two species, similar to those reported for lentic populations. Using 12 biological, 22 physical, and 8 chemical variables collected concurrently with the fish, we developed simple- and multiple-regression models of growth for each species and size. Our best multiple-regression models accounted for 67-99% of the growth variation in seven species-size combinations, with substrate variables contributing to models for all species except rock bass. Although these models require testing against independent data for general applicability, they demonstrate the potential for predicting the growth of stream fish from commonly collected, and often readily available, habitat data. These empirical relationships with environmental variables may also enhance the efficiency of stream fisheries management by providing an inexpensive, a priori basis for directing management efforts.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				MAR	1995	124	2					252	261		10.1577/1548-8659(1995)124<0252:RBEVAS>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1995)124<0252:RBEVAS>2.3.CO;2													WOS:A1995QN16000010

The pond was divided into four sections with plastic curtains and stocked with crucian carp (Carassius carassius); two sections had low (4.4-5.5 g m-3) and two high (10.4-13.7 g m-3) densities of fish. In the summer of 1987, the pond was sampled weekly for phyto- and zooplankton until the fish were removed by rotenone in September after a three month experiment. Fish density as well as the extent of macrophyte cover had a considerable impact on planktonic communities and water quality. Mean zooplankton biomass was significantly lower and phytoplankton biomass higher, at high fish density. Water transparency was correlated negatively with chlorophyll-a at low fish density but turbidity appeared to reduce transparency at high fish density. The composition and dynamics of the plankton also differed at different fish densities. The mechanisms behind these effects, and the influences of habitat and fish behaviour on the results, are discussed.

However, there is no generally accepted method to directly measure dry deposition. In this study the particulate dry deposition of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) was measured using smooth surrogate surfaces during the winter of 1996-1997 in Chicago. Concurrently, ambient air samples were collected. Average particulate Sigma(13)-PAH fluxes and ambient concentrations were 120 +/- 28 mug/m(2) d and 30 +/- 16 ng/m(3), respectively. The measured particulate dry deposition fluxes were similar to those measured in other urban areas. Overall dry deposition velocities of PAHs calculated using the dry deposition fluxes and ambient concentrations averaged 4.5 +/- 3.1 cm/s. This value is higher than values typically used to estimate PAH particulate deposition, however, it agrees well with values determined using similar techniques. The overall dry deposition velocity for individual PAHs generally decreased with increasing molecular weight. This finding is consistent with the previous experimental studies that have shown that a greater fraction of the higher molecular weight PAHs are associated with fine articles relative to the lower molecular weight compounds.					; Odabasi, Mustafa/A-5200-2009	Holsen, Thomas/0000-0001-9599-6733; Odabasi, Mustafa/0000-0002-0506-0470													0733-9372					MAR	2002	128	3					269	274		10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9372(2002)128:3(269)	http://dx.doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9372(2002)128:3(269)													WOS:000174046800010

Water hyacinth decline across Lake Victoria - Was it caused by climatic perturbation or biological control? A reply	AQUATIC BOTANY												Several authors have identified that a combination of interacting factors involving the El Nino of 1997/1998 and biocontrol by weevils resulted in the rapid reduction of water hyacinth across Lake Victoria [Albright, T.P., Moorhouse, T.G., McNabb, J., 2004.

It would appear to us that any disagreement between these papers centres on the order and magnitude of the contributory factors. In this reply we reiterate that whilst weevils almost certainly played their part, the synchronous lake wide reduction of water hyacinth during the second quarter of 1998 was the result of the 1997/1998 El Nino.

J	EHRLICH, HL; ZAPKIN, MA				EHRLICH, HL; ZAPKIN, MA			MANGANESE-RICH LAYERS IN CALCAREOUS DEPOSITS ALONG THE WESTERN SHORE OF THE DEAD-SEA MAY HAVE A BACTERIAL ORIGIN	GEOMICROBIOLOGY JOURNAL												spore formers were detected in samples of calcareous crust with manganiferous laminations and in water from the Dead Sea in Israel. They were able to grow in media made with fresh water but not with synthetic Dead Sea water. Some of these spore formers were also able to oxidize Mn(II) in fresh water. No other bacteria capable of both growth and Mn(II) oxidation in hypersaline media prepared with synthetic Dead Sea water were found in the samples. However, bacteria capable of growth and Mn(II) oxidation in fresh water media were detected in water and sediment from fresh water springs at Ein Feshkha and in lake water and sediment from the beach near Wadi Kidron. Both sites are located on the western shore of the lake. These findings suggest that the manganiferous laminations in calcareous crusts and concretions in the Dead Sea along its western shore may have originated, at least in part, from manganese oxide formed by bacteria in fresh water environments on shore and washed into the lake in runoff, with subsequent incorporation into the crusts and concretions.																			0149-0451	1521-0529					1985	4	2					207	221		10.1080/01490458509385932	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01490458509385932													WOS:A1985ALA6200008

We follow the quantitative parameters of parasitism and the impact of parasitism on the development of fish. From March 2016 to February 2017, we examined 578, 565 and 629 individuals in Sekkak, Ghrib and Guenitra dams respectively. The rate of infection varies depending on the site (p-value < 5%). The prevalence is 0.86% in Sekkak, 2.22% in Guenitra and 10.26% in Ghrib. Respectively, the mean intensity of infection is equal to 1.2, 5.2 and 1.3. The occurrence of the parasite is higher in all dams during autumn. Major allometric growth was observed in parasitized individuals in the three dams (b = 3.19 for Ghrib, b = 3.98 for Sekkak and b = 3.44 for Guenitra) and minor allometric growth in non-parasitized individuals (b = 2.98 to Ghrib, b = 2.98 to Sekkak and b = 2.92 to Guenitra), with a significant difference between parasitized and healthy individuals in the three dams (p < 5%). Overweight fish are influenced by parasitism in Ghrib dam (parasitized individuals: Kp = 1.03 +/- 0.07 and healthy individuals: Ks = 1.06 +/- 0.11 (p < 5%)) contrariwise to Sekkak and Guenitra (parasitized individuals: Kp = 1.09 +/- 0.18 in Sekkak, 0.97 +/- 0.09 in Guenitra; healthy individuals: Ks = 1.04 +/- 0.14 in Sekkak, 1.03 +/- 0.12 in Guenitra) (p > 5%). At Ghrib dam, the parasitism varies depending on the groups of both size and age (p < 5%), on the contrary to the condition factor (p > 5%).

Aqueous volume loss associated with occlusion break surge in phacoemulsifiers from 4 different manufacturers	JOURNAL OF CATARACT AND REFRACTIVE SURGERY												Purpose: To evaluate aqueous volume losses associated with occlusion breaks at varying vacuum limits in phacoemulsification systems from 4 different manufacturers. Setting: Alcon Research Ltd., Lake Forest, California, USA. Design: Experimental study. Methods: The anterior chamber was modeled using the spring eye model. Systems tested included the Centurion, Whitestar Signature, Stellaris PC, and EVA. Occlusion breaks were actuated at vacuum limits of 200, 300, 400, 500, and 600 mm Hg and a target intraocular pressure of 55 mm Hg. Results: The model eye piston reached its measurement limit just below 600 mm Hg on the EVA and just above 400 mm Hg on the Stellaris PC. Higher vacuum limits could not be tested on these 2 units. Surge volumes varied from 17 to 77 mu L on the Centurion, 30 to 103 mu L on the Whitestar Signature, 67 mu L to 163 mu L on the Stellaris PC, and 47 to 165 mu L on the EVA. Assuming an average phakic eye aqueous volume of 250 mu L, these mu L values correspond to percent aqueous volume losses of 7% to 31% on the Centurion, 12% to 41% on the Whitestar Signature, 27% to 65% on the Stellaris PC, and 19% to 66% on the EVA. Surge responses increased on all machines with each increment in vacuum limit. The Centurion had the lowest surge volumes across all vacuum limits. Conclusions: Occlusion break surge volumes vary considerably across phacoemulsification platforms. Severe chamber shallowing might occur if an occlusion break occurs under high vacuum on some systems.

J	Brandi, A; Manoli, G				Brandi, Aldo; Manoli, Gabriele			Meteorological Assessment of Vertical Axis Wind Turbine Energy Microgeneration Potentials Across Two Swiss Cities Located in Complex Terrain	WIND ENERGY												Wind energy is the most mature renewable energy technology; however, its exploitation in cities is often met with skepticism. Thanks to their ability to operate at low wind speed regardless of direction, vertical axis wind turbines (VAWTs) offer an attractive opportunity for wind energy harvesting in cities. However, limited evidence exists on their potential in complex urban environments, and the role of different geographical settings, local meteorological conditions, and urban characteristics remains unclear. Here, we use realistic Weather Research and Forecast model high-resolution wind speed simulations alongside representative VAWT power curves to quantify the range of microgeneration potentials at the annual, seasonal, and diurnal scale across two Swiss cities (Lausanne and Geneva) residing in complex terrain. Our results show that Lausanne generally experiences higher (+24%) wind speed than Geneva. Both cities present the greatest microgeneration potential during the summer months, although Lausanne shows nonnegligible potential also during the wintertime. Wind speed is higher during the nighttime in Lausanne and during the daytime in Geneva, due to the different interaction between the local lake-breeze circulation and the synoptic flow. Simulated performance of case-study VAWTs is dominated by cut-in wind speed and power curve inflection point. On average, in 2022, an individual VAWT would have produced 2867 kWh of total annual electricity, equivalent to 17.8 m2 of photovoltaic panels. These results highlight the need for research on urban wind energy featuring detailed city-scale assessments that account for urban heterogeneities and regional circulation patterns, to inform future planning investments and engineering development.

In this study, Structure from Motion (SfM) technique was used to rebuild the study area with high overlapped images acquired by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). We generated orthoimages and SfM dense point cloud data, from which vegetation indices (VIs) and SfM point cloud variables including average height (H-AvG), standard deviation of height (H-SD) and coefficient of variation of height (H-CV) were extracted. These VIs and SfM point cloud variables could effectively characterize the growth status of aquatic plants, and thus they could be used to develop a simple linear regression model (SLR) and a stepwise linear regression model (SWL) with field measured ABB samples of aquatic plants. We also utilized a decision tree method to discriminate different types of aquatic plants. The experimental results indicated that (1) the SfM technique could effectively process high overlapped UAV images and thus be suitable for the reconstruction of fine texture feature of aquatic plant canopy structure; and (2) an SWL model based on point cloud variables: H-AVG. H-SD, H-CV and two VIs: NGRDI, ExGR as independent variables has produced the best predictive result of ABB of aquatic plants in the study area, with a coefficient of determination of 0.84 and a relative root mean square error of 7.13%. In this analysis, a novel method for the quantitative inversion of a growth parameter (i.e., ABB) of aquatic plants in wetlands was demonstrated.

J	Laxton, NF; Burn, CR; Smith, CAS				Laxton, NF; Burn, CR; Smith, CAS			Productivity of Loessal grasslands in the Kluane lake region, Yukon territory, and the Beringian ''production paradox''	ARCTIC												The Beringian ''Production Paradox'' is posed by abundant evidence that large ungulates populated unglaciated portions of northwestern North America and adjacent northeast Asia during the late Pleistocene, while botanical data from the same period suggest a poorly productive tundra environment. It is not clear how the large animals sustained themselves, but portions of Beringia, locally in receipt of loess, may have harbored sufficient forage-producing plants to nourish these animals. Loessal soils in the region today are warm and dry in summer, and are often used as rangelands. The loessal hypothesis was examined on grasslands in the Kluane Lake area, southwest Yukon Territory, at sites which have recently received loess blown from the Slims River delta. The biomass and species diversity of grasslands around the lake increase with the quantity of silt in the soil. Likewise, soil fertility indices, including total nitrogen, available nitrogen (NH4), and total carbon, increase with silt content, particularly at sites where the soil surface has been stable for some time, and a ''humified'' loess (Ahk) horizon has developed. These results support the hypothesis that sites in receipt of loess may have played a significant role in the vegetative productivity of the Beringian ecosystem.

Grain size distributions (GSDs) can provide information on sediment sources, transport processes and sedimentary environments. As a result, GSD is the most frequently applied proxy in reconstruction of past eolian dust activities of the ACA using lake sediments. The GSD dataset for a core spanning the last similar to 850 years from Kuhai Lake on the northeastern Tibetan Plateau was unmixed by end-member analysis (EMA) for reconstruction of past eolian dust activities on the southeastern margin of the ACA. The results suggest that EM 2 and EM 3, which were added together to form an eolian dust activity proxy, represent the proximal eolian suspension and saltation loads, respectively. The fractional abundances of EMs suggest that siliciclastic materials in the studied core were mainly from eolian contributions. The occurrence of enhanced eolian dust activities within the cold Little Ice Age period together with the GSDs of EM 2 and EM 3 indicate that eolian dust activities on the southeastern margin of the ACA were basically governed by the Siberian High-produced Asian Winter Monsoon over the last millennium. At decadal to centennial scales, enhanced eolian dust activities generally correspond to warm periods with high total solar irradiance (TSI). Increased temperatures as the result of high TSI would have caused larger increases in evaporation than in precipitation, and hence deteriorated vegetation cover and increased dust sources availability.

Tibet is one of the world's best-known areas with strongest solar radiation. Observation of solar radiation on the ground in Tibet can provide field data for solar energy utilization and research on atmospheric environment etc.. A systematic field observation was conducted to observe the surface solar spectrums, solar global irradiance and solar UV irradiance in Tibet by using the German RAMSES hyperspectral Irradiance Sensors, the Dutch CMP6 Pyranometers and the Norwegian NILU-UV Multi-filter Radiometers. The monthly spectral characteristics of Lhasa, Tibet, for 2017 were observed. The results of solar spectral observations at the local noons (13:55BJ) of Lhasa for the two equinoxes and the two solstices were reported. The ground spectra of Tibet were compared with the standard spectra of AM1.5 and AM0. The characteristics of global solar irradiance and solar ultraviolet intensity in Lhasa and Naqu of Tibet were observed and studied. It is found that the spectral intensities for visible and infrared lights in summer even exceed the corresponding wavelength spectral intensities of the AM0 spectra in Lhasa. In other words, the spectral intensities for visible and infrared lights on the surface of Lhasa occasionally exceed the spectral intensities of the corresponding radiation at the top of the atmosphere. The maximum spectral value of Lhasa usually occurs at wavelengths of about 476.6 nm, and the maximum observed in summer solstice in 2017 is about 2.331 W.m(-2).nm(-1). However, the observation of solar UV radiation (280 similar to 400 nm) spectrum shows that the spectral intensity of the ground solar UV region is always significantly lower than that of the corresponding intensity of the AM0 spectrum. Although Lhasa is located at about 3 680 meters above sea level, the ground measurements of the local noon solar UV spectrums indicate that the wavelengths less than 300 nanometers of UV irradiances are almost zeroes in Lhasa, which means that the solar UV irradiance with wavelengths less than 300 nm is absorbed by the atmosphere and does not reach the ground. It indicates that the short-wave solar UV radiations are absorbed effectively by atmospheric ozone. At the same time, the characteristics of the solar spectra at the high altitude of Tibet and lower places in Beijing and Chengdu are observed and studied, and the information on atmospheric composition and content in various places are revealed. The results of the solar global irradiance in Tibet during July of 2010-December of 2013 are reported. The results show that about 18% of the global irradiances in Lhasa exceed the solar constant (1 367 W.m(-2)). It is found that the instantaneous maximum value of the global irradiance in Lhasa reaches 1 756.09 W.m(-2) (June 24, 2011). The observation results of solar UV radiation in Tibet during July of 2008-December of 2013 are also reported. The results show that the averaged daily maximum value of UVA for both Lhasa and Naqu is about 67 W.m(-2), and the maximum value of UVB for the same places is about 5.1 W.m(-2). The daily maximum values of UVA and UVB for both Lhasa and Naqu are maintained a good consistency. During the observation period of more than 5 years, there was no obvious enhancement or weakening trend for the UV intensities.																			1000-0593					JUN	2019	39	6					1683	1688		10.3964/j.issn.1000-0593(2019)06-1683-06	http://dx.doi.org/10.3964/j.issn.1000-0593(2019)06-1683-06													WOS:000474674300005
J	Center, TD; Dray, FA				Center, Ted D.; Dray, F. Allen, Jr.			Bottom-up control of water hyacinth weevil populations: do the plants regulate the insects?	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												P>1. Nutrient availability varies widely in aquatic systems and is likely to profoundly affect the outcomes of plant-herbivore interactions in aquatic environments. This has implications in programmes aimed at the biological control of water weeds. We hypothesized that nutrient flux seasonally affects ovarian development of two specialist weevil species, Neochetina eichhorniae and Neochetina bruchi, thereby influencing population growth on the floating plant Eichhornia crassipes. 2. We also hypothesized that the weevils differed in their sensitivities to nutritional quality and interacted differently depending on host quality. 3. To test these hypotheses, we cultured E. crassipes plants under 20 fertilizer regimens then introduced reproductively dormant, over-wintering female weevils as single or mixed species populations. They were later retrieved and dissected to ascertain ovarian status. F-1 progeny was extracted biweekly to compare fecundity with population growth. 4. Ovaries regained functionality and the reproductive proportion of the population increased with fertilizer rate as did the fecundity of reproductive individuals. F-1 progeny increased exponentially from 7 to over 300 weevils tank-1 in the highest fertilizer treatment. 5. Mixed species treatments produced more offspring under high fertilizer rates than single species treatments (236 +/- 32 mixed vs. 155 +/- 25 N. bruchi or 170 +/- 33 N. eichhorniae pure). Neochetina eichhorniae was more productive throughout than N. bruchi, but N. bruchi performed nearly as well in high fertilizer treatments. 6. Ratios of the two species remained consistent whether in single or mixed species populations suggesting a lack of interspecific interference. However, N. eichhorniae seemed more adaptable to a wider range of plant quality and more tolerant of lower nutritional circumstances. 7. Synthesis and applications. The coupling of reproductive status of the parental generation with the population response of the F-1 generation indicates that plant quality drives population growth of both weevil species, demonstrating bottom-up regulation. This largely explains the variable performance of these weevils as biological control agents. These results emphasize the importance of considering bottom-up regulation in evaluating host range trials, predicting efficacy and in post-release evaluations. In addition, they suggest that partial herbicide treatments to accomplish phased removal of infestations could enhance the quality of the remaining plants, thereby better integrating biological control into current E. crassipes management systems.																			0021-8901	1365-2664				APR	2010	47	2					329	337		10.1111/j.1365-2664.2009.01769.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2009.01769.x													WOS:000275334400011

However, how the fine grain sediments in this region were transported to the CLP remains debatable. In this study, we dated aeolian sediments, alluviums, beach sediments, and sand wedges in the northeastern QTP using optical dating, combined with previously reported ages, explored the aeolian sediment deposition patterns in this region. The dating results shown that aeolian sediments mainly accumulated during the marine isotope stage (MIS) 3 and since the last deglaciation, alluvial sediments mainly deposited during the middle to late MIS 3 (between similar to 40 ka and 22 ka), and sand wedges formed during the MIS 4 and MIS 2 cold intervals. Based on the sedimentary stratigraphic characteristics and existing optical dating chronologies, we propose that fine grain sediments in the northern and northedstern QTP were eroded and carried to the CLP by westerly wind during last glacial and stadial cold stages. However, during last interglacial and interstadial warm stages, aeolian sediments deflated from western barren lands and deserts were mainly trapped in the northeastern QTP, and some were transported to the Alax arid zone or Yinchuan-Hetao plain by rivers that flow out of QTP, then transported to the CLP by northwesterly Asian winter monsoon (AWM). This cold stage westerly wind transport, warm stage rivers plus AWM transport pattern has existed at least since the late middle Pleistocene. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Adopting IPv6 over 6LoWPANs (Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Networks) is instrumental in communicating across diverse domains within WSNs, albeit with its challenges. Particularly, resource limitations and security vulnerabilities remain significant concerns. 6LoWPAN-based M2M protocols that rely on authentication and key establishment schemes (AKE) often fall short due to inadequate security issues and excessive resource requirements. This paper addresses these challenges by introducing a secure and resource-efficient framework-Lightweight AKE for 6LoWPAN Nodes (LAKE-6LN). LAKE-6LN capitalizes on the clustering architecture's merits and contrasts conventional router-centric approaches. To ensure lightweight and efficient operation, it uses hash functions, XOR functions, and symmetric encryption techniques. Pseudo-identity, sequence tracking numbers, and secure parameters ensure privacy and protection against attacks, including traceability, perfect forward secrecy, ephemeral secret leakage, and secure the session key. An informal analysis of LAKE-6LN's security confirms that compliance with all essential security properties has been achieved. In addition, the framework's logical robustness and security analysis are rigorously verified using BAN logic, AVISPA, and Scyther tools. LAKE-6LN has demonstrated superior performance over related schemes, demonstrating a reduction in storage costs (by 33.33 % to 85.71 %), computational overhead (by 14.28 % to 95.97 %), communication overhead (by 16.12 % to 51.85 %), and energy consumption (by 22.04 % to 99.40 %). In our comparative analysis, LAKE-6LN demonstrates its resilience against various security threats, demonstrating its potential to secure 6LoWPAN networks in M2M.					; Hasan, Mohammad Kamrul/NES-9292-2025; abdullah, salwani/M-1679-2019; Ashrif, Fatma/LKM-5924-2024; Alshwaiyat, Rami/AAJ-2260-2020; Wazirali, Raniyah/IVU-8004-2023	Wazirali, Raniyah/0000-0002-3609-9351; Alshwaiyat, Rami/0000-0003-3913-6397; A.

Long-term impacts of prescribed fire on stand structure, growth, mortality, and individual tree vigor in Pinus resinosa forests	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Prescribed fire is increasingly being viewed as a valuable tool for mitigating the ecological consequences of long-term fire suppression within fire-adapted forest ecosystems. While the use of burning treatments in northern temperate conifer forests has at times received considerable attention, the long-term (>10 years) effects on forest structure and development have not been quantified. We describe the persistence of prescribed fire effects in a mature red pine (Pinus resinosa Ait.)-dominated forest in northern Minnesota, USA over a similar to 50 year period, as well as the relative roles of fire season and frequency in affecting individual tree and stand-level structural responses. Burning treatments were applied on 0.4 ha compartments arranged in a randomized block design with four blocks. Burning treatments crossed fire season (dormant, summer) and frequency (annual, biennial, and periodic), and include an unburned control for comparison. Treatments were applied from 1960 to 1970, with no further management interventions occurring since. Data were collected periodically from 1960 to 2014. Forest structural development trajectories were significantly altered by the application of fire treatments. Burning treatments led to lower overstory densities, lower stand basal area, and larger tree diameters when compared to the unburned control over the study period. Differences between burning treatments were less apparent suggesting that the application of burning itself rather than a particular season and/or frequency of burning drives this long-term response. Overstory tree mortality and stand growth showed little or no response to burning treatments. In addition, we detected no impact of burning on long-term overstory tree growth efficiency (based on assessments >40 years post burning) suggesting these treatments had little cumulative effect on tree vigor. Our results indicate that the effects of burning treatments on structural dynamics are not ephemeral, but rather alter stand development trajectories in the long-term. The persistent nature of these effects highlights their potential as a tool for long-lasting structural alterations in treated stands without compromising overstory tree growth and vigor.

The amount of CH4 emitted at ice melt is partially determined by the interplay between CH4 production and CH4 oxidation, performed by methane-oxidizing bacteria (MOB). Yet the balance between oxidation and emission and the potential for CH4 oxidation in various lakes during winter is largely unknown. To address this, we performed incubations at 2 degrees C to screen for wintertime CH4 oxidation potential in seven lakes. Results showed that CH4 oxidation was restricted to three lakes, where the phosphate concentrations were highest. Molecular analyses revealed that MOB were initially detected in all lakes, although an increase in type I MOB only occurred in the three lake water incubations where oxidation could be observed. Accordingly, the increase in CO2 was on average 5 times higher in these three lake water incubations. For one lake where no oxidation was measured, we tested if temperature and CH4 availability could trigger CH4 oxidation. However, regardless of incubation temperatures and CH4 concentrations, ranging from 2 to 20 degrees C and 1-500M, respectively, no oxidation was observed. Our study indicates that some lakes with active wintertime CH4 oxidation may have low emissions during ice melt, while other and particularly nutrient poor lakes may accumulate large amounts of CH4 below ice that, in the absence of CH4 oxidation, will be emitted following ice melt. This variability in CH4 oxidation rates between lakes needs to be accounted for in large-scale CH4 emission estimates.

DIATOM RESEARCH												Mastogloia is one of the few species-rich diatom genera the majority of whose taxa inhabit the marine environment with only a small number of taxa in freshwater habitats. An ongoing revision of the Macedonian diatom flora, mainly over the last decade, has revealed many previously misidentified taxa. Currently, seven freshwater Mastogloia taxa have been recorded from Macedonia: M.elliptica (C.Agardh) Cleve, M.dansei (Thwaites) W. Smith, M.grevillei W. Smith, M.lacustris (Grunow) Grunow, M.ohridana Cvetkoska & Levkov, M.albertii nom. nov. and M. sterijovskii sp. nov. The main morphological features have been analysed with light and scanning electron microscopy. These taxa inhabit a variety of freshwater habitats, including oligotrophic rivers, eutrophic ponds, mine lakes, thermo-mineral springs, with one species from fossil sediments of ancient Lake Ohrid. Mastogloia albertii nom. nov., which we also lectotypify, is a new name for M.smithii var. amphicephala Grunow, since the latter is clearly distinct from the lectotype of M.smithii Thwaites. In addition, one of the observed taxa does not fit within any previously described Mastogloia taxa and is hereby described as a new species, M. sterijovskii. Mastogloia sterijovskii was found as epizoic on the dorsal carapace of the European pond turtle, Emys orbicularis Linnaeus, from the Mladost reservoir near Veles, central Macedonia. This species resembles M.albertii in valve outline, but can be distinguished by the shape of the valve apices and its size.

Changes in Aluminum Concentrations and Speciation in Lakes Across the Northeastern US Following Reductions in Acidic Deposition	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												We surveyed 113 lakes in the northeastern U.S. in 2001 that had previously been sampled in 1986 to evaluate the effects of reductions in acidic deposition on the concentrations and speciation of aluminum (Al). We found ubiquitous decreases in the concentrations of total Al and inorganic monomeric aluminum (Al(i)) across the region. Median total Al decreased from 1.45 to 1.01 mu mol L(-1) across the region, with the largest decrease in the Adirondacks; (4.60 mu mol L(-1) to 2.59 mu mol L(-1)). Organic monomeric aluminum (Al(o)) also decreased region-wide and in all the subregions except the Adirondacks. The speciation of Ali shifted from largely Al-F complexes in 1986 to largely Al-OH complexes in 2001 in ponds whose concentrations were above the detection limit (>0.7 mu mol L(-1)). In 2001, only seven lakes studied, representing a population of 130 lakes in the region, had Al(i) concentrations above a toxic limit of 2 mu mol L(-1) compared with 20 sample lakes, representing 449 lakes, in 1986. Thus,we estimate that more than 300 lakes in the northeastern United States no longer have summer Al(i) concentrations at levels considered harmful to aquatic biota.

Downstream Ecological Impacts of Controlled Sediment Flushing in an Alpine Valley River: A Case Study	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												Sediment flushing may be effective to tackle the loss of reservoir storage as a result of siltation. When operationally possible, the impact of this practice on the downstream aquatic environment can be mitigated by limiting the sediment concentration of the discharged waters (controlled sediment flushing). However, this topic is poorly documented, and concerns arise when limits are discussed. We present the results of a 3-year field investigation concerning the controlled sediment flushing of a small reservoir on the Adda River, the main tributary of Lake ComoItaly. Two limits for suspended solid concentration (SSC) were adopted: 1.5gL(-1), as average value throughout the whole working day, and 3.0gL(-1), as alert threshold to adjust the ongoing activity. These constraints were essentially fulfilled in the course of the documented operations. The first year sediment flushing was more significant than the following year: 25000 tons of fines below 2mm in diameter were flushed in six non-consecutive days in summer 2010, while, one year earlier, 75000 tons were flushed in 16 non-consecutive days. In the third year of investigation (2011), no sediment evacuation took place. The benthic macroinvertebrate and the fish communities were surveyed a short distance below the reservoir, that is, in the potentially more affected river reach. Clear pieces of evidence of environmental quality degradation were not detected; the adopted strategies can therefore be considered to be appropriate when planning sediment flushing management in comparable contexts.

The phytoplankton of the northern Lake Baikal litter included more than 30 forms of algae. The leading forms of plankton were Anabaena lemmermannii and A. flos-aquae f. flos-aquae of the blue-green algae; Rhizosolenia longiseta, Attheya zachariasii, Melosira granulata var. angustissima and Asterionella gracillima of the diatoms. The most intensively developed of the green algae were Crucigenia fenestrata, Dictyosphaerium pulchellum var. pulchellum D. ehrenbergianum and species of Scenedesmus. The most numerous of the golden algae were Dinobryon divergens var. divergens and D. bovaricum var. bovaricum. The total number of phytoplankton in the litter varied from 637 thousand to 949 thousand cells per liter, the biomass from 750 to 1150 mg/3 . Along the eastern bank, where the summer development of algae was extraordinarily poor, such algae as Dinobryon d. divergens, Ankistrodemus pseudomirabilis Korshik., Anabaena sp., Botryococcus braunii were also encountered in very small quantities. The horizontal distribution of invididual hydrochemical components as a whole corresponded rather well with the distribution of the phytoplankton and with its photosynthetic activity.																			0002-3264						1964	156	5					1193	+																WOS:A19649752A00072

We stratified our observations in Glacier National Park, Montana, USA, and Waterton Lakes National Park, Alberta, Canada, in valleys with three wolf (Canis lupus L., 1758) population levels (Saint Mary Valley: no wolf; Waterton Valley: moderate wolf; North Fork Valley: high wolf). Although the lowest elk vigilance occurred in Saint Mary and the highest in the North Fork, our analysis revealed a complex picture. Our model included distance to forest edge, group size, distance to road, social class, and impediments to detecting and escaping wolves. In Saint Mary, none of the variables were significant. In Waterton, vigilance decreased as elk group size increased (p < 0.00001) and increased as impediments increased (p = 0.0005). In the North Fork, vigilance increased as group size increased (p = 0.03), bulls were more vigilant (p = 0.02), and the interaction between group size and impediments was significant (p = 0.03). Where a high wolf population existed, elk did not exhibit uniform or expected response to predation risk factors. High wolf presence may necessitate adaptive elk behaviour that differs from response to moderate wolf presence.

The lakes of northeastern Poland provide a wide range of freshwater ecosystems differing in morphology, hydrology and ecology. In this study, we investigate 30 lakes during summer stagnation, considering their varying levels of anthropogenization of the catchment area and taking into account increased tourist activity. MPs were found in each of the studied lakes in the range from 0.27 MPs/L to 1.57 MPs/L, and the average value was 0.78 +/- 0.42 MPs/L. The features of the MPs were evaluated, including size, form and color (most frequent: 4-5 mm (35.0 %); fragments (36.7 %); blue (30.6 %), respectively). Gradual accumulation of MPs has been observed in the lakes that comprise the hydrological sequence. The amount of sewage produced by wastewater treatment plants was considered in the study area. Statistically significant differences were found between lakes with different surface areas and shoreline lengths, where lakes with the highest and smallest values were notably more polluted with MPs than lakes in the medium range (F = 34.64, p < .0001 and F = 5.96, p < .01, respectively). The study presents an easy-to-obtain shoreline urbanization index (SUI) that is particularly useful for lakes with heavily transformed catchments in terms of hydrology. A significant correlation between the MP concentration and SUI, reflecting the degree of direct catchment anthropopression (r = +0.4282; p < .05), was observed. The analysis of the human impact on shoreline conversions and development should also pique the interest of other researchers as a potential indicator of MP pollution.

J	FRENETTE, JJ; DODSON, JJ				FRENETTE, JJ; DODSON, JJ			BROOK TROUT (SALVELINUS-FONTINALIS) POPULATION-STRUCTURE IN ACIDIFIED LAC TANTARE, QUEBEC	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												To present evidence of acid-induced stress, the population structure and distribution of brook trout (S. fontinalis) in acidified Lac Tantare was studied. Trout > 21 cm represented only 16.2 and 10% of the population sampled in 1979 and 1980, respectively. Survival rates of trout from 1979-1980 indicated higher survival among individuals > 25 cm, mortality occurring primarily among fish of 13-25 cm. The marked decline in numbers of fish occurring at 21 cm coincided with the size at which 50% of the female trout population reached sexual maturity, suggesting that postspawning mortality contributed to the high mortality observed among these fish. Comparisons of population and individual growth rates revealed that smaller fish of age-classes 1-5 suffered higher mortality than larger individuals of these age-classes, implicating mortality agents other than those related to spawning. Evidence was provided to support the hypothesis that the most probable cause of mortality was size-related differential exposure to toxic stress whereby small brook trout (< 25 cm) were found in lake areas (brooks) exhibiting the most potentially toxic combination of pH and Al, enhancing the exposure of the most susceptible part of the population to toxic stress. Large brook trout (.gtoreq. 25 cm) were found in the safest lake areas (springs), diminishing the exposure of the least susceptible part of the population to toxic stress and enhancing survival. Female trout exhibited delayed sexual maturity relative to other Quebec populations, attaining 50% maturity at age 3 and a length of 21-24 cm such that the major part of the population''s reproductive effort was provided by those fish representing only 15% of the population in 1979 and 1980. During the Oct. spawning season, 20% of potential spawners exhibited retarded oogenesis. These reductions in reproduction effort and changes in spawning site selection provided evidence in support of the hypothesis that recruitment failure may have occurred in the Tantare brook trout population.																			0706-652X	1205-7533					1984	41	6					865	877		10.1139/f84-103	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f84-103													WOS:A1984SY55400004

WATER												Currents are one of the main factors favoring the dispersal of microscopic planktic organisms over inland lakes and rivers. Large rivers of the northern hemisphere, flowing from south to north, can increase the diversity of northern latitudes with boreal species, while high water levels and floods expand the range of ecotopes and the biodiversity of rivers. We studied the distribution of the taxonomic structure and species richness of scaled chrysophytes downstream of the Ob river-a large river in West Siberia-at the end of the high-water period (June). Methods of scanning and transmission microscopy allowed the determination of a high taxonomic richness of these organisms, 67 species in total. The species were unevenly distributed by stations, with the maximum number of species (54) occurring in a shallow still bay without current and with minimum turbidity and a small number of diatoms. The species diversity in the main current was represented mainly by ubiquitous and cosmopolitan species.Water level fall usually coincides with the end of the vegetation of many scaled chrysophytes and the formation of stomatocysts. The stomatocysts of different species may drift downstream and then germinate when they find suitable conditions at theappropriatetime. Large rivers that are subject to significant changes in water level during their hydrologicalperiodsare able to host ahigh diversity of microscopic planktic organisms. Studying this capacity may reinforce the hypothesis of an omnipresence, i.e., that "everything is everywhere".					; Bessudnova, Anna/J-5485-2018; Khoroshavin, Vitaliy/NJR-2586-2025; Likhoshway, Yelena/J-4496-2018; Soromotin, Andrei/H-3408-2013	Bessudova, Anna/0000-0002-6569-0052; Likhoshway, Yelena/0000-0002-2432-9260; Soromotin, Andrei/0000-0002-7771-4592														2073-4441				SEP	2023	15	17							3054	10.3390/w15173054	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w15173054													WOS:001060635200001

Does habitat occupancy by lake trout and lake whitefish in large lakes match published thermal habitat envelopes?	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												Habitat occupancy patterns of lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) and lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) in two large Canadian Shield lakes were modelled based on detections of fish from repeated depth-stratified surveys over several summers. Lake trout and lake whitefish consistently occupied sites outside traditional thermal envelopes and were not detected at some sites within these ranges. This included the metalimnion and shallow epilimnion for lake trout and lake whitefish in Lake Opeongo. Physical habitat covariates were not important in defining lake trout habitat in both lakes. Physical habitat as represented by the hardness/softness gradient based on acoustic substrate surveys was important for lake whitefish in Lake Opeongo but not in Smoke Lake. In addition, thermal envelopes for lake whitefish differed between the lakes possibly because of differences in substrate slope. The wash zone of lakes, where the thermocline contacts the substrate, appears to be a physical habitat feature for lake whitefish in some lakes. Lake whitefish also exhibited diurnal activity behaviour that was reflected through greater detection rates in the morning versus the afternoon. By accounting for imperfect detection, true estimated overall occupancy of lake trout and lake whitefish increased 0.15-0.30 over naive occupancy. Thermal habitat envelopes for lake trout and lake whitefish are wider than previously thought. Lake trout occupied a consistent thermal habitat envelope while lake whitefish varied between lakes likely because of lake specific differences in basin morphology and wash zone.																			0906-6691	1600-0633				OCT	2019	28	4					611	623		10.1111/eff.12479	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eff.12479													WOS:000485976400009

Based on measurements of transient tracers (sulfur hexafluoride, CFC-12, H-3, He-3, He-4, Ne), dissolved oxygen, light transmission, conductivity-temperature-depth profiles, and thermistor data, we investigate the implications associated with lake level fluctuations for deep-water renewal and oxygenation. Our data suggest that deep-water renewal was significantly reduced in Lake Van between 1990 and 2005. This change in mixing conditions resulted in the formation of a more than 100 m thick anoxic deep-water body below 325 m depth. Apparently, the freshwater inflows responsible for the lake level rise between 1988 and 1995 decreased the salinity of the surface water sufficiently that the generation of density plumes during winter cooling was substantially reduced compared to that in the years before the lake level rise. Significant renewal and oxygenation of the deep water did not occur until at least 2005, although by 2003 the lake level was back to almost the same level as in 1988. This study suggests that short-term changes in the hydrological regime, resulting in lake level changes of a couple of meters, can lead to significant and long-lasting changes in deep-water renewal and oxic conditions in deep saline lakes.					; Lorke, Andreas/B-9195-2008; karabıyıkoğlu, mustafa/AAD-7443-2019; Tomonaga, Yama/ABG-9540-2020	Tomonaga, Yama/0000-0003-2871-8826; Lorke, Andreas/0000-0001-5533-1817; 													0043-1397	1944-7973				NOV 3	2010	46								W11508	10.1029/2009WR008555	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2009WR008555													WOS:000283951500002
J	Guralnick, R				Guralnick, R			Life-history patterns in the brooding freshwater bivalve Pisidium (Sphaeriidae)	JOURNAL OF MOLLUSCAN STUDIES												Of all freshwater molluscs, the life history of sphaeriid bivalves has been one of the best studied, partly because they brood their young. In Pisidium, one of five genera in the Sphaeriidae, offspring develop and are released synchronously and therefore the reproductive state is easily determined from collections of adults. This study examines life-history trade-offs, morphological constraints on reproductive effort, intraclutch variation and brood production differences in different habitats in the pea clam, Pisidium. My results challenge previous ideas about life-history trade-offs in the pea clams and are as follows: (1) there is a trade-off between offspring number and size, larger embryos being found in smaller clutches when controlling for adult body size; (2) total embryo area is highly correlated with total gill area, but the measured maximum total area of embryos relative to gill area is rarely achieved; (3) intraclutch variance itself varies non-normally across Pisidium and does not appear to relate strongly to other measured variables; (4) creeks, ponds, springs and marshes appear to have higher relative per-clutch brood production than lakes in the best-sampled taxon, P. casertanum. Relative brood production is lower in high alpine lakes (above 3350 m), perhaps due to low dissolved organic material and ions.

The importance of cation exchange processes in the upper organic and upper B soil horizons was demonstrated using lysimeter water data from a recharge area and soil water flow simulated with SOIL model during winter rain events with high sea-salt concentration. The importance of the hydrological conditions, such as water flow and water pathway, silicate weathering and the ion exchange of Al with Hf on the streambed materials in controlling cation concentrations in soil and stream waters are also discussed. With the SAFE model, the contribution of cations from ion exchange by depletion of base cations from the exchange matrixes compared to from weathering was also assessed. SAFE calculations indicate that the release rate of base cation by ion exchange to runoff water has decreased since 1945 and is very low, approx. 0.1 keq/ha per year, at present time as a result of soil acidification due to S and N inputs.																			0049-6979					DEC	1995	85	3					1819	1824		10.1007/BF00477244	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00477244													WOS:A1995UD33500127

We found that: (1) the GI is able to effectively map gypsum blooms in the Salton Sea with a relatively high accuracy (85 %); (2) the largest gypsum bloom area was observed in summer (August and September), with notable gypsum blooms lasting more than 40 days in 2003, 2005, 2006, 2016, and 2018; (3) the gypsum bloom-infested waters shifted from the center to the southeastern shore of the lake during 2003-2018, and the frequency of gypsum blooms significantly increased since 2008. Meanwhile, the temporal and spatial differences between the northwestern and south-eastern lake increased over the observation period; and (4) discoloration occurred in the gypsum bloom-infested waters and lasted for 14 days on average, longer periods of discoloration (more than 20 days) occurred d in 2002, 2016, and 2018. The reconstruction of gypsum bloom dynamics in the Salton Sea provides valuable information for the practical management and restoration of the Salton Sea.

In the present study, Arthrospira strains were isolated from freshwater and brackish lakes in Myanmar, and their osmoprotective adaptation was investigated as it was for the genus Synechococcus strains. The Arthrospira strains showed satisfactory growth up to 1.0 M sodium chloride, suggesting their acclimation to high salinity stress. Cloning and phylogenetic analysis of ggpS, which encodes an osmolyte glucosylglycerol-phosphate synthase (GgpS), showed that the cyanobacterial strains possess a GgpS-based osmoprotective mechanism, except for Synechococcus strains of freshwater origin. The Arthrospira spp. strains fell into the same cluster in the GgpS phylogeny, suggesting their close taxonomic relationship. One exception was Arthrospira sp. TT-1 (II); the ggpS (II), possibly a paralogue of the ggpS (I), branched out from the cyanobacterial cluster. These findings suggest the wide distribution of the genus Arthrospira in freshwater to brackish environments is ascribed to its glucosylglycerol production as an osmoprotectant and resulting in salt acclimation.																			1342-4815	1884-0205				JUN	2011	16	2					55	61		10.4265/bio.16.55	http://dx.doi.org/10.4265/bio.16.55								21719990					WOS:000292118700002

Three Nodularia strains were isolated from summer blooms in experimental shrimp production ponds of Penaeus vannamei in Rio Grande, in southern Brazil; these strains were characterized by morphology, phylogeny, growth rate and toxicity. The strains were identified as N. spumigena based on the size of vegetative cells, heterocytes and akinetes under a light microscope and based on the number of gas vesicles per mu m(2) under a transmission electron microscope. The 16S rRNA gene sequences of the three strains showed high identity (> 99%) with N. spumigena sequences available on the NCBI database but were grouped closer in the phylogenetic tree with N. spumigena strains from Australia and USA than those from the Baltic Sea. The growth rate in batch culture varied between 0.2 and 0.6 mu d(-1) based on cell density, optical density and chlorophyll-a content. The three strains produced the hepatotoxin nodularin (ELISA plate kit) with similar toxicity values (4.8-4.9 mu g l(-1)). We conclude that the three isolated strains are N. spumigena with similar rates of growth and nodularin production. The presence of N. spumigena now represents a potential problem in aquaculture and estuarine environments in Brazil.

Specimens were analyzed from both geothermally heated hotsprings (35.degree.-37.degree. C) and from isolated cool pools (28.degree. C) and from stocks acclimated to 20.degree. C in the laboratory. The ratios of (ATP)/(ADP) and (ATP)/(ADP) (Pi) decreased with increasing body temperature consistent with an increase in glycolysis and tissue respiration rates, respectively. The apparent equilibrium constant of creatine kinase (KCK), (creatine) (ATP)/(phosphorylcreatine) (ADP) was found to decrease with increasing temperature: 20.2 (20.degree. C), 13.9 (28.degree. C), 8.0 (37.degree. C). A near constant muscle and blood pH (or slight increase in alkalinity with higher temperatures) was found regardless of body temperature (Blood pH 7.64, 7.74, muscle pH 7.27, 7.51 at 20.degree.

This paper chose split window algorithm to retrieve land surface temperature after comparing with single window algorithm and multi-band algorithm, and improves the split window algorithm of AVHRR so as to be suitable for MODIS image data. In this paper, land surface temperature is retrieved by split window algorithm based on MODIS' images, and the temporal and spatial characteristics of Beijing urban beat island as well as its influencing factors are also analyzed. The result indicates that: Without particular atmosphere parameter, analysis on urban heat island effect based on split window algorithm of Beijing is available.

J	Loseto, LL; Lean, DRS; Siciliano, SD				Loseto, LL; Lean, DRS; Siciliano, SD			Snowmelt sources of methylmercury to high arctic ecosystems	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Mercury in humans and other top predators living in the Arctic is present at elevated levels. Since only methylmercury (MeHg) bioaccumulates in food chains, sources of MeHg need to be identified. Recently, wetlands in the High Arctic were found to produce MeHg, and this was confirmed in laboratory soil incubations. In the present study both wetlands and snowmelt water were evaluated as sources of MeHg to Arctic ecosystems in Nunavut. Three substudies took place on Cornwallis Island, and one took place on Ellesmere Island. First, the effect of wetland presence in lake watersheds was evaluated by comparing four lakes with wetlands present to four lakes without wetlands present. Next,two individual wetlands were spatially and temporally investigated. Finally, three basin tributaries were evaluated for snowmelt MeHg sources. Catchments on Cornwallis Island with wetlands did not have an observable effect on MeHg levels in downstream lake water, but the wetland on Ellesmere Island contributed significant MeHg. In contrast, calculated yields of MeHg in tributaries draining snowmelt on Cornwallis Island were higher (ca. 1.5 mg km(-2) day(-1)) than those measured in temperate catchments characterized by wetlands. Methylmercury and total Hg concentrations in lakes, wetlands, and basin tributaries showed a strong temporal trend that corresponded to inputs from snowmelt water in late spring. This study revealed that wetland export of MeHg to downstream Arctic lakes is site dependent, and snowmelt water was the most significant source of MeHg to Arctic ecosystems located on Cornwallis Island.

J	Sarmaja-Korjonen, K; Hyvärinen, H				Sarmaja-Korjonen, K; Hyvärinen, H			Subfossil littoral Cladocera as indicators of brackish-water Littorina transgression of the Baltic Basin in a small lake in Finland	BOREAS												The study aimed to investigate the value of freshwater littoral Cladocera (chydorids, Ophryoxus gracilis and Sida crystallina) in stratigraphical studies of shore displacement of the Baltic Sea. Diatoms and Cladocera were analysed from a sediment core from Lake Ruokolampi (S Finland, 60degrees34'N, 27degrees26'E), where a brackish-water Baltic transgression (Littorina Sea) is clearly expressed by changes in lithology. The diatom flora indicates a development of the waterbody from an Ancylus Lake bay to a small lake that was subject to a brackish Littorina transgression followed by another small-lake stage. There was a rich chydorid fauna in the Ancylus Lake bay and the following small lake. Littoral Cladoceran diversity fell sharply at the onset of the brackish transgression; however, three species (Alona rectangula, Alona affinis and Chydorus sphaericus s.l.) appear to have been tolerant of the saline conditions. Concentrations of all species rose rapidly after the transgression. Littoral Cladocera appear to react to the inflow of brackish water as sensitively as the diatoms and may provide a valuable additional method for pinpointing Baltic Sea transgression and isolation events, especially in cases where the diatom and biostratigraphical evidence is not as clear as in the Ruokolampi sequence.																			0300-9483					DEC	2002	31	4					356	361		10.1080/030094802320942563	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/030094802320942563													WOS:000179504000004

LoW is a large bi-national water body with complex geometry and topography and receives significant nutrients mainly from the Rainy River, with additional inputs from a few other smaller tributaries, and suffers from degraded water quality with seasonal cyanobacterial and harmful algal blooms. A high-resolution model developed here has a horizontal grid resolution of 250 m with a variable vertical grid resolution and can simulate hydrodynamics, in-lake nutrients dynamics, and phytoplankton biomass. Our model reproduced observed temporal and spatial distribution of nutrient and chlorophyll-a concentrations reasonably well. The calibrated model is used to explore simulating the spatial and temporal variability of ecological conditions of the lake and its response to nutrient load reductions. Based on a range of potential nutrient loadings, the model results suggest that different areas within LoW may respond differently to decreased phosphorus loadings. The model simulations predict that as nutrient loads into LoW decrease, water quality conditions will improve in most of the segments. In addition to naturally reducing internal load, external load reductions of 160 MTA from the baseline conditions (877 MTA) are necessary to reduce late summer average TP concentrations to 0.03 mg/L and total chlorophyll-a concentrations in the range of 7- 12 lg/L.Crown Copyright & COPY; 2022 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of International Association for Great Lakes Research.

Geomorphic evolution of glacier-fed Baspa Valley, NW Himalaya: record of Late Quaternary climate change, monsoon dynamics and glacial fluctuations	HIMALAYAN CRYOSPHERE: PAST AND PRESENT	Geological Society Special Publication				13th International Symposium on Antarctic Earth Sciences	JUL, 2015	INDIA	Int Council Sci, Sci Comm Antarctic Res				In glacier-fed Baspa River valley, Late Quaternary climatic changes are archived in the terraces, fan and landslide deposits. An initial optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) based stratigraphy of these deposits is developed to deduce geomorphic evolution and palaeoclimatic changes. The data show large alluvial fan progradation around Sangla till c. 45 ka (middle of marine isotope stage 3 or MIS-3) due to glacial retreat and readjustment of glacigenic sediment under warm and humid conditions followed by incision. During the end phase of MIS-3 (>23 ka), intensified precipitation blocked the river course near Sangla and Kharogla by rock avalanches and imposed lacustrine conditions which recorded sedimentation until the beginning of Holocene (c. 11.4 ka). Reduced sedimentation in these lakes during the last glacial maximum (LGM) c. 23-18 ka suggests a cold and arid climate, whereas increased sedimentation during c. 18-11.5 ka indicates a warm and humid climate post-LGM. A palaeolake breach occurred during early Holocene and incision continued throughout the Holocene, with a pulse of fluvial aggradation during c. 9.1-6.5 ka over lacustrine remnant. In the upper reach of the valley (Chitkul area), coeval aggradation continued from >28 ka until c. 19 ka (MIS-3 to LGM) under cold and relatively arid conditions. This study emphasizes that Late Quaternary geomorphic evolution of Baspa valley is well synchronous with glacial fluctuations and the rapid response of the glacifluvial system to Indian summer monsoon (ISM) dynamics.																			0305-8719		978-1-78620-324-3				2018	462						51	72		10.1144/SP462.5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1144/SP462.5													WOS:000460278200005

Cyanobacterial life at low O2: community genomics and function reveal metabolic versatility and extremely low diversity in a Great Lakes sinkhole mat	GEOBIOLOGY												Cyanobacteria are renowned as the mediators of Earths oxygenation. However, little is known about the cyanobacterial communities that flourished under the low-O2 conditions that characterized most of their evolutionary history. Microbial mats in the submerged Middle Island Sinkhole of Lake Huron provide opportunities to investigate cyanobacteria under such persistent low-O2 conditions. Here, venting groundwater rich in sulfate and low in O2 supports a unique benthic ecosystem of purple-colored cyanobacterial mats. Beneath the mat is a layer of carbonate that is enriched in calcite and to a lesser extent dolomite. In situ benthic metabolism chambers revealed that the mats are net sinks for O2, suggesting primary production mechanisms other than oxygenic photosynthesis. Indeed, 14C-bicarbonate uptake studies of autotrophic production show variable contributions from oxygenic and anoxygenic photosynthesis and chemosynthesis, presumably because of supply of sulfide. These results suggest the presence of either facultatively anoxygenic cyanobacteria or a mix of oxygenic/anoxygenic types of cyanobacteria. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing revealed a remarkably low-diversity mat community dominated by just one genotype most closely related to the cyanobacterium Phormidium autumnale, for which an essentially complete genome was reconstructed. Also recovered were partial genomes from a second genotype of Phormidium and several Oscillatoria. Despite the taxonomic simplicity, diverse cyanobacterial genes putatively involved in sulfur oxidation were identified, suggesting a diversity of sulfide physiologies. The dominant Phormidium genome reflects versatile metabolism and physiology that is specialized for a communal lifestyle under fluctuating redox conditions and light availability. Overall, this study provides genomic and physiologic insights into low-O2 cyanobacterial mat ecosystems that played crucial geobiological roles over long stretches of Earth history.

Between 2007 and 2010, 265 samples were collected from 89 Korean water source locations. NoV GI was detected in 4.5% and NoV GII in 1.5%. Samples collected in winter had the highest occurrence; 9.4% for NoV GI and 6.3% for NoV GII. NoV GI detection was highest in groundwater, with the next highest in river water and the lowest in lake water (5.9%, 5.4%, and 1.6%, respectively), and NoV GII was found only in river water. When three representative Korean basin systems (Han (H)-, Geum/Seom (G/S)-, and Nakdong (N)-river basins) were compared, both NoV genogroups were high in the G/S-, but absent in the H- river basin. The most prevalent genotypes within the GI and GII groups were GI.5 and GII.4, respectively. The NoVs found in surface water were identical to those found in patients and those found in groundwater. The NoVs appeared to be transmitted from the patient to the surface water, and then to the groundwater, suggesting a fecal-oral route of transmission. This is the first nationwide surveillance of NoV in major Korean water sources.																			1017-7825	1738-8872				APR	2014	24	4					556	562		10.4014/jmb.1311.11089	http://dx.doi.org/10.4014/jmb.1311.11089								24487938					WOS:000335092400014

A typical increasing trend of the nonylphenol (NP) content was revealed along the water flow direction of this lake. Carbonated NPEOn (NPEnC) showed an increasing trend from upstream to downstream, with the total concentrations of the NPEOn falling in the range of 2.13 to 23.1 mu g/kg dry.

Pollen and charcoal stratigraphies, and loss-on-ignition were analysed from a 0-294-cm profile cored from the deepest part of the small lake. The pollen profile was divided into six local pollen assemblage zones Kir 1-6 and dated by three radiocarbon samples. Lake Kirjavalampi was isolated from Lake Ladoga between 1460-1300 B.C., when the River Neva was formed as a new outlet for Lake Ladoga and the water level rapidly fell. The isolation is seen as a phase of rapid sedimentation in Kir 2 (237-173 cm). Spruce (Picea) starts to decline at 113 cm ca. A.D. 70, and the earliest cereal (Secale cereale) pollen was encountered at the 97-cm level, empirically dating the onset of cultivation to ca. A.D. 600. A marked intensification in agricultural activities occurs around A.D. 1200, and the indication of an open cultivated landscape is at its strongest during the time period 1700 to 1850.					; Alenius, Teija/AAS-1906-2021	alenius, teija/0000-0003-2965-5177; 													0939-6314	1617-6278				MAR	2004	13	1					23	31		10.1007/s00334-003-0030-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00334-003-0030-7													WOS:000220088300002

Beginning in 1983, a long term study of fertilization effects was initiated in the Kuparuk River. Increased nutrient supply stimulated algal and microbial biomass and microbial activity, which in tum affected the larval growth and abundance of Prosimulium. This experiment allowed us to isolate the effects of nutrient supply from other factors in determining black fly growth and abundance. Phosphorus addition had the following indirect effects on Prosimulium: growth was higher, but abundance decreased in the enriched section, leading to a net decrease in secondary production from 2.62 g m-2 yr-1 to 0.77 g m-2 yr-1. Prosimulium emergence rates were not measureably affected. The decrease in abundance and production appears to be a result of competitive displacement by the caddisfly Brachycentrus americanus which increased in abundance in the fertilized section of the river.																			0018-8158					SEP 21	1992	240	1-3					259	265		10.1007/BF00013467	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00013467													WOS:A1992JQ94000022

We experimentally manipulated salamander densities in 12 natural pools (three replicates each of four densities) and simultaneously monitored salamander populations in 27 control pools on two islands. The experiment demonstrated that increasing density significantly reduced survival and growth, and increased the skew in the size distributions of individuals. Each of these responses was also observed in the undisturbed natural populations. Density effects were probably due to interference because (1) natural variation in the densities of prey taxa did not influence salamander performance in the experiment, (2) salamander density had no effect on prey availability, and (3) tail damage from attacks by conspecifics was widespread and positively correlated with density. We conclude that density dependence is commonplace in salamander larvae, and probably makes an important contribution to regulating the population size of Ambystoma laterale at Isle Royale.

Our objective was to quantify C&R mortality for Muskellunge in a southern reservoir.MethodsWe conducted a radiotelemetry study in Stonewall Jackson Lake, West Virginia, a reservoir in the southern portion of the Muskellunge's distribution that supports a popular trophy fishery. We estimated C&R and total mortality using radio-tagged fish and evaluated changes to size structure under simulated warmwater season closures.ResultAll mortalities of tagged fish occurred during the warmwater period, when surface water temperatures tended to exceed 25 degrees C (i.e., June-August), regardless of whether fish were angled (3 of 27; 11.1%) or not (3 of 65; 4.6%). Simulated season closures yielded only small increases in the numbers of fish reaching preferred (>= 1020-mm), memorable (>= 1140-mm), and trophy (>= 1270-mm) sizes across all simulations. Low mortality was likely due to the presence of ample thermal refuge availability within a well-defined thermocline in Stonewall Jackson Lake.ConclusionAlthough we observed greater survival of Muskellunge angled during the warmwater period than has been reported in previous work, their catchability was also greater, which may contribute to greater total mortality in high-use systems. Therefore, managers should consider the trade-offs between survival and catchability as functions of thermal refuge availability when developing Muskellunge management plans.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				NOV	2024	153	6					697	713		10.1002/tafs.10497	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/tafs.10497		DEC 2024											WOS:001370405200001

Seven sites belonging to Dachigam (DACZ) and Dara zone (DARZ) catchment, three sites from the confluence zone (WANZ), and two sites at the downstream end (TELZ) were selected characterized by varying degrees of anthropogenic pressures. Biological Monitoring Working Program, and Average Score Per Taxon at the upstream zones (DACZ, DARZ, and WANZ) recorded significantly higher scores with water quality indices falling within the good category than the downstream zone (TELZ). Taxa richness, and diversity indices of benthic macroinvertebrates recorded higher values at the upstream zones (DACZ, and DARZ), and confluence zone (WANZ), compared to the downstream zone (TELZ). Results revealed that phylum Arthropoda was most dominant contributing 37 invertebrate families (constituting 90% of the total macroinvertebrate community, including Crustacea and Arachnida) while phylum Mollusca and Annelida constitute 5% each. Macroinvertebrate families Baetidae, Erpobdellidae, Gammaridae, Chironomidae, and Heptagenidae contributed significantly to the similarity and dissimilarity between the sampling zones. The best subset of environmental variables (BIOENV) test revealed that the distribution of benthic macroinvertebrate assemblage in the Dachigam-Dara catchment is driven by pH, electrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen, and phosphate phosphorous. The upstream zones (DACZ, and DARZ) and confluence zone (WANZ), compared to the downstream zone (TELZ) suggest progressive shift of pollution sensitive macroinvertebrate taxa to pollution tolerant taxa in response to anthropogenic activities in the stream ecosystem over time.

J	HERSTEINSSON, P				HERSTEINSSON, P			MAMMALS OF THE THINGVALLAVATN AREA	OIKOS												Mammals are poorly represented among the wild terrestrial fauna of Iceland. Only arctic foxes Alopex lagopus are indigenous to the country. However, wood mouse Apodemus sylvaticus and American mink Mustela vison, introduced by man, are also integral parts of the ecosystem of the Lake Thingvallavatn area now. Arctic foxes exhibit violent long-term fluctuations with the latest population trough occurring in the early 1970s and a continuous population increase since then. This increase is at least partly due to influx of foxes from the southwest. The size of the mink population is partly limited by the extent of ice-free areas on lakes and rivers during winter as evidenced by negative correlation between mink catches and ice cover of Lake Thingvallavatn. Wood mice exhibit irregular population explosions. Domestic mammals are chiefly represented by sheep, dairy cattle and Icelandic ponies. also termed Icelandic toelter horses. Sheep and ponies, grazing in pastures with active erosion, represent a certain threat to some areas around Lake Thingvallavatn. Cattle, however, are grazed only in cultivated fields and lowland meadows and can not be regarded as a threat to soil or vegetation. The number of sheep has been declining in the area while the number of ponies has increased in recent years.

Quantitative simulations of the paleoclimate have consistently failed to agree with information from plant and animal fossils and climate sensitive sediments. The cold continental interior paradox' (first described by DeConto et al. in Barrera E, Johnson C (eds) Evolution of the Cretaceous Ocean/climate system, vol 332. Geological Society of America Special Paper, Boulder, pp 391-406, 1999), has been an enigma, with extensive continental interiors, especially in northeast Asia, modeled as below freezing in spite of plant and other evidence to the contrary. We reconsider the paleoelevations of specific areas, particularly along the northeastern Siberian continental margin, where paleofloras indeed indicate higher temperatures than suggested by current climate models. Evidence for significant masses of ice on land during even the otherwise warmest times of the Cretaceous is solved by reinterpretation of the O-18 record of fossil plankton. The signal interpreted as an increase in ice volume on land is the same as the signal for an increase in the volume of groundwater reservoirs on land. The problem of a warm Arctic, where fossil floras indicate that they never experienced freezing conditions in winter, could not be solved by numerical simulations using higher CO2 equivalent greenhouse gas concentrations. We propose a solution by assuming that paleoelevations were less than today and that there were much more extensive wetlands (lakes, meandering rivers, swamps, bogs) on the continents than previously assumed. Using similar to 8xCO(2) equivalent greenhouse gas concentrations and assuming 50-75% water surfaces providing water vapor as a supplementary greenhouse gas on the continents reduces the meridional temperature gradients. Under these conditions the equatorial to polar region temperature gradients produce conditions compatible with fossil and sedimentological evidence.					; Flögel, Sascha/AAC-7786-2022	Floegel, Sascha/0000-0002-2818-5532; 													1437-3254	1437-3262				MAR	2019	108	2					587	620		10.1007/s00531-018-1670-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00531-018-1670-2													WOS:000462464500012
J	Kawano, S				Kawano, Shoichi			Life-history monographs of Japanese plants. 11: Polygonum thunbergii Sieb. et Zucc. (Polygonaceae)	PLANT SPECIES BIOLOGY												The life-history characteristics and demography of Polygonum thunbergii Sieb. et Zucc. (Polygonaceae) are described here. This is a typical annual species of the Polygonaceae, extending widely over wetlands in the lowlands of the Japanese Islands and in north-eastern Asia. A unique feature of P. thunbergii is that each individual plant possesses two reproductive systems, that is, chasmogamy and cleistogamy. Chasmogamous flowers are borne on the cymose inflorescences with 10-20 flowers, reddish to pinkish in color, that attract various insects. A variety of pollinators visit the flowers, including horse flies and small butterflies, which obviously guarantees a certain degree of outbreeding among different individuals. The achenes produced are ovoid, trigonous, yellowish-brown and dull in color and do not possess any specific seed dispersal mechanisms. Several cleistogamous flowers are produced at the tip of underground runners elongated from the base of the stems into the soil layers. The reproductive strategy of P. thunbergii is unique as an annual and the two reproductive systems (chasmogamy and cleistogamy [geocarpy]) allow populations to persist in unstable changing environments, such as the flood plains of rivers and wetlands developed at the margins of ponds or lakes.																			0913-557X					DEC	2008	23	3					222	227		10.1111/j.1442-1984.2008.00226.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1442-1984.2008.00226.x													WOS:000260724200010
J	Mosquera, PV; Batalla, M; Hampel, H; Vázquez, RF; Catalan, J				Mosquera, Pablo V.; Batalla, Meritxell; Hampel, Henrietta; Vazquez, Raul F.; Catalan, Jordi			Mixing regimes in tropical high-mountain Andean lakes	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Lowland tropical lakes deeper than 15 m are typically warm monomictic, but whether the regime may switch to polymixis at high elevations remains uncertain. Using a year-long high-frequency dataset from thermistor chains from 10 deep lakes and occasional temperature profiles from 202 lakes in Ecuador's Cajas Massif, this study examines the mixing regimes in tropical high-Andean lakes. We identified monomictic, polymictic, and discontinuous polymictic regimes. Lakes with a mean depth < 7 m are typically polymictic, while deeper lakes are mostly monomictic, resisting wind, and daily temperature oscillations for much of the year. Persistent low stability occurs between July and September, coinciding with intertropical synoptic meteorological fluctuations. During the stable period, the water column is structured into a nearly top-to-bottom progressive stepwise temperature gradient, which, in the deepest (> 40 m maximum depth), the structure occupies only part of the water column, deepening as the stable period advances, occasionally producing a thermal stratification that might resemble that of temperate lakes in summer but with a weaker thermocline. Daily fluctuations, with nighttime convective mixing, dominate thermal variation. Quasi-periodic (biweekly) increases in wind and cloudiness mix the upper layers. The stable period shortens with elevation and transparency for lakes of similar depth and size. Existing generalized scaling of seasonal thermal stratification applies satisfactorily to these lakes. However, fitting the formulation specifically to them downplays the role of water transparency in favor of air-water boundary heat transfer factors. Discontinuous polymixis emerges as a transient regime under a narrow set of mean depth and transparency combinations.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				2025 AUG 15	2025										10.1002/lno.70166	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.70166		AUG 2025											WOS:001551484600001

Seasonal and Diel Movements of Adult Yellow Perch Between Two Contrasting Lakes (Lake Union and Lake Washington) in the Seattle Metropolitan Area	NORTHWEST SCIENCE												We examined the seasonal movements of adult yellow perch (Percaflavescens) between a small, shallow lake (Lake Union) and a large, deep lake (Lake Washington). Lake Union is the largest part of the Lake Washington Ship Canal (LWSC), a narrow waterway between Lake Washington and Puget Sound. Yellow perch were implanted with acoustic tags that had a battery life of at least 460 days. All tagged yellow perch were captured and released in Lake Union in the summer of 2020 or 2021. Movements were monitored primarily with 14 stationary receivers that were deployed at key locations between the two lakes. Additional information was obtained from mobile tracking and other stationary receivers in Lake Washington. Of the 47 fish tagged, we were able to get seasonal movement data on 28 fish. Twenty-three (82%) of them left Lake Union and moved into Lake Washington while the other five (18%) remained in the LWSC. Most movements from Lake Union to Lake Washington occurred in September or October when water temperatures were decreasing. Return movements from Lake Washington to Lake Union had variable timing. Migrations between Lake Union and Lake Washington usually took just a few hours and took place day or night. The farthest observed distance moved from the release site was approximately 16 km. Within Lake Washington, tagged yellow perch were found over a broad area in the northern twothirds of the lake. Overall, tracking results indicated yellow perch can make extensive migrations between the two lakes.

A comparison of fire severity measures: An Australian example and implications for predicting major areas of soil erosion	CATENA					International Meeting of Fire Effects on Soil Properties	JAN 31-FEB 03, 2007	Barcelona, SPAIN	Univ Barcelona, GRAM				Modelled results of two popular fire severity measures NBRdiff and NDVIdiff were compared with field data for two small wildfires that occurred in eucalypt-dominated forest near Sydney, Australia during the spring of 2006. NBRdiff and NDVIdiff are computed by differencing specific spectral reflectance properties of satellite images captured before and after the fire event. In this case indices were derived from the Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper platform. It is demonstrated that the spatial distribution of severity classes computed using NBRdiff were not statistically different to severity classes computed for NDVIdiff in the Tallowa fire, which was a 'hot' burn. However, in the 'cooler' Thirlmere Lakes fire, their respective classifications differed significantly. NBRdiff was clearly Superior to NDVIdiff in discriminating lower fire severities, which predominantly burn understorey vegetation whilst leaving the canopy un-scorched. It is also demonstrated using post-fire soil profiles from 50 sample sites that charring depth, which is related to the hydrophobic properties of the soil landscape, is significantly correlated to fire severity. This has important implications for the probability of developing a soil erosion risk model based on remotely sensed data, because in this environment, charred soil landscapes will have lost some of their naturally highly water repellent behaviour during burning, which in turn alters their susceptibility to overland flow development and surface wash erosion.

However, our understanding of the prehistoric human occupation of and interaction with this inhospitable environment has been hindered by a lack of direct evidence from settlements. Here we present the results of the first systematic study of archaeological material and radiocarbon dates from newly-discovered Bronze Age settlements in the hyper-arid Lop Nur region, in the eastern Tarim Basin. The studied settlement (the North Loulan Settlement, NLS), apparently associated with the prehistoric Xiaohe Culture, which is known from the Xiaohe and Gumugou cemeteries, is especially significant for the study of the prehistoric desert-oasis civilization in the drylands of the Asian interior, because it is quite different from any of the contemporary cultures in the surrounding regions. Based on a synthesis of Bayesian-modeled radiocarbon dates, the age of the NLS falls within the range of ca. 2051-1774 BC. Our field investigations indicate that the inhabitants of the site occupied semi-subterranean/semi-cave dwellings on the upper part of high yardangs, suggesting that they were able to utilize island-like yardangs in order to adapt to lake or wetland terrains. The new chronological framework for the Xiaohe cultural sites indicates that the NLS was the first Xiaohe settlement in the Tarim Basin. The earliest settlers, who were influenced by oriental culture, may have migrated to the NLS along the eastern or northeastern corridors. Later, there was the migration of populations westward along rivers.

Competitive Replacement of Invasive Congeners May Relax Impact on Native Species: Interactions among Zebra, Quagga, and Native Unionid Mussels	PLOS ONE												Determining when and where the ecological impacts of invasive species will be most detrimental and whether the effects of multiple invaders will be superadditive, or subadditive, is critical for developing global management priorities to protect native species in advance of future invasions. Over the past century, the decline of freshwater bivalves of the family Unionidae has been greatly accelerated by the invasion of Dreissena. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the current infestation rates of unionids by zebra (Dreissena polymorpha) and quagga (D. rostriformis bugensis) mussels in the lower Great Lakes region 25 years after they nearly extirpated native unionids. In 2011-2012, we collected infestation data for over 4000 unionids from 26 species at 198 nearshore sites in lakes Erie, Ontario, and St. Clair, the Detroit River, and inland Michigan lakes and compared those results to studies from the early 1990s. We found that the frequency of unionid infestation by Dreissena recently declined, and the number of dreissenids attached to unionids in the lower Great Lakes has fallen almost ten-fold since the early 1990s. We also found that the rate of infestation depends on the dominant Dreissena species in the lake: zebra mussels infested unionids much more often and in greater numbers. Consequently, the proportion of infested unionids, as well as the number and weight of attached dreissenids were lower in waterbodies dominated by quagga mussels. This is the first large-scale systematic study that revealed how minor differences between two taxonomically and functionally related invaders may have large consequences for native communities they invade.

Data from 30 lakes in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River indicate that the nutrient gradient was the major factor affecting the distribution of chironomids across these sites. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) revealed that of 12 summer water environmental variables, total Phosphorus was most important, accounting for 20.1% of the variance in the chironomid data. This was significant enough to allow the development of quantitative inference models. A TP inference model was developed using weighted averaging (WA), partial least squares (PLS) and weighted averaging partial least squares (WA-PLS). An optimal two-component WA-PLS model provided a high jack-knifed coefficient of prediction for conductivity r(jack)(2) = 0.76, with a low root mean squared error of prediction (RMSEPjack = 0.13). Using this model it is possible to produce long-term quantitative records of past water quality for lacustrine sites across the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, which has important implications for future lake management and ecological restoration.					; Zhang, Youchi/M-6989-2016	Zhang, Enlou/0000-0002-8057-7760; 													1001-6538	1861-9541				SEP	2006	51	17					2125	2132		10.1007/s11434-006-2062-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11434-006-2062-8													WOS:000241849200014
J	Morrill, C; Small, EE; Sloan, LC				Morrill, C; Small, EE; Sloan, LC			Modeling orbital forcing of lake level change: Lake Gosiute (Eocene), North America	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												The sedimentary record of Lake Gosiute, a lake that existed in southwestern Wyoming during the Eocene, contains evidence for lake level fluctuations thought to be caused by the earth's precession cycle. However, it is not clear how the effects of these orbital variations were transferred through the climate system and into the sedimentary record. We carry out a series of experiments using a general circulation model (GCM), a lake energy balance model and a lake water balance model to better understand the processes by which these orbital variations could have altered lake evaporation, on-lake precipitation and runoff from the lake's catchment. GCM simulations indicate significant differences in surface incident shortwave radiation between the two end-members of the precession cycle. These differences cause lake evaporation to be similar to 25% higher when perihelion occurs at the summer solstice. GCM simulations also indicate significant seasonal changes in the amount of precipitation between the two end-members, but no change in the annual mean precipitation. Preliminary experiments with a lake water balance model show that local effects such as changes in vegetation, in snowmelt runoff, or in the area of mudflats surrounding the lake could have a large impact on lake level. However, more data need to be collected to determine the importance of these effects. Our results challenge previous interpretations of paleoclimate that were based on geologic data and simple assumptions regarding the effects of orbital variations on the water balance of the lake. In particular, we find that (1) changes in shortwave radiation may have been more important than changes in temperature or moisture in causing lake level fluctuations and (2) changes in catchment and lake characteristics should be further examined. In order to make an accurate reconstruction of past climatic change from a lake level record, climate system processes and local non-climatic variables must be considered explicitly.

J	Jones, RI; Grey, J; Sleep, D; Arvola, L				Jones, RI; Grey, J; Sleep, D; Arvola, L			Stable isotope analysis of zooplankton carbon nutrition in humic lakes	OIKOS												Carbon stable isotopic composition was determined for zooplankton, POM, DOM and, in two cases, phytoplankton from 12 small forest lakes in southern Finland during summer 1997. The lakes were selected to provide a wide range of water colour (12-365 mg Pt l(-1)) but minimum variability in other limnological characteristics. POM and DOM showed similar stable isotope ratios (delta(13)C around - 28 parts per thousand, comparable with values commonly reported for terrestrial C-3 vegetation) and these showed no relationship to water colour. Zooplankton were consistently depleted in C-13 relative to the bulk POM on which they might feed. This relative C-13 depletion increased significantly with water colour. Therefore the zooplankton must have been feeding selectively on isotopically light food sources and doing so to a greater extent in the more humic lakes. Although phytoplankton were C-13-depleted relative to POM, their abundance and their variability between lakes did not appear to explain adequately the observed trend in zooplankton stable isotope ratios. We propose that some zooplankton were grazing on methanotrophic bacteria which utilise isotopically light methane derived from allochthonous organic matter decomposed under anaerobic conditions. This process would be more pronounced in coloured lakes with a higher loading of allochthonous organic matter and greater development of hypolimnetic anoxia.					; Jones, Roger/C-7703-2011; Grey, Jonathan/B-3346-2012	Grey, Jonathan/0000-0001-9069-2271; Arvola, Lauri/0000-0003-1380-0659; Jones, Roger/0000-0002-0835-8264; 													0030-1299					JUL	1999	86	1					97	104		10.2307/3546573	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3546573													WOS:000081267100009
J	Hoh, E; Zhu, LY; Hites, RA				Hoh, E; Zhu, LY; Hites, RA			Dechlorane plus, a chlorinated flame retardant, in the Great Lakes	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												A highly chlorinated flame retardant, Dechlorane Plus (DP), was detected and identified in ambient air, fish, and sediment samples from the Great Lakes region. The identity of this compound was confirmed by comparing its gas chromatographic retention times and mass spectra with those of authentic material. This compound exists as two gas chromatographically separable stereoisomers (syn and anti), the structures of which were characterized by one- and two-dimensional proton nuclear magnetic resonance. DP was detected in most air samples, even at remote sites. The atmospheric DP concentrations were higher at the eastern Great Lakes sites (Sturgeon Point, NY, and Cleveland, OH) than those at the western Great Lakes sites (Eagle Harbor, MI, Chicago, IL, and Sleeping BearDunes, MI). At the Sturgeon Point site, DIP concentrations once reached 490 pg/m(3). DP atmospheric concentrations were comparable to those of BDE-209 at the eastern Great Lakes sites. DP was also found in sediment cores from Lakes Michigan and Erie. The peak DIP concentrations were comparable to BDE-209 concentrations in the sediment core from Lake Erie but were about 30 times lower than BDE-209 concentrations in the core from Lake Michigan. In the sediment cores, the DP concentrations peaked around 1975-1980, and the surficial concentrations were 10-80% of peak concentrations. Higher DP concentrations in air samples from Sturgeon Point, NY, and in the sediment core from Lake Erie suggest that DP's manufacturing facility in Niagara Falls, NY, may be a source. DP was also detected in archived fish (walleye) from Lake Erie,suggesting that this compound is, at least partially, bioavailable.

By modulating habitat complexity, AV has the potential to influence the early ontogenetic stages of many fish species. However, understanding how variations in AV abundance influence fish distribution and abundance at the landscape scale of freshwater ecosystems is a considerable challenge due to the difficulty of collecting the high-resolution data needed for such analyses. We used yellow perch (Perca flavescens) as a biological model to test the hypothesis that larval fish abundance is positively related to a AV-rich landscape. Combining seven years of extensive larval sampling and satellite imagery, our results suggest that fish larvae tend to be associated with AV habitats after hatching. Based on zero-inflated binomial models, the probability of observing perch larvae increased from approximately 20% in low AV habitats to nearly 100% in dense AV habitats (pseudo-R-2 = 0.54). Our results also show that the probability of observing yellow perch larvae was lower during years of low water level and low AV biomass, likely limiting the availability of proper spawning or nursery habitats for fish. Furthermore, we demonstrate that larvae use both new AV as well as vegetative debris from the previous year that persisted through the winter. In agreement with a growing literature, our study gives additional support to the idea that AV plays a key role in freshwater fish recruitment.

Methane production and bubble emissions from arctic lakes: Isotopic implications for source pathways and ages	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												[1] This study reports an atmospheric methane ( CH4) source term previously uncharacterized regarding strength and isotopic composition. Methane emissions from 14 Siberian lakes and 9 Alaskan lakes were characterized using stable isotopes ( 13 C and D) and radiocarbon ( 14 C) analyses. We classified ebullition ( bubbling) into three categories ( background, point sources, and hot spots) on the basis of fluxes, major gas concentrations, and isotopic composition. Point sources and hot spots had a strong association with thermokarst ( thaw) erosion because permafrost degradation along lake margins releases ancient organic matter into anaerobic lake bottoms, fueling methanogenesis. With increasing ebullition rate, we observed increasing CH4 concentration of greater radiocarbon age, depletion of 13 CCH4, and decreasing bubble N2 content. Microbial oxidation of methane was observed in bubbles that became trapped below and later within winter lake ice; however, oxidation appeared insignificant in bubbles sampled immediately after release from sediments. Methanogenic pathways differed among the bubble sources: CO2 reduction supported point source and hot spot ebullition to a large degree, while acetate fermentation appeared to contribute to background bubbling. To provide annual whole- lake and regional CH4 isofluxes for the Siberian lakes, we combined maps of bubble source distributions with long- term, continuous flux measurements and isotopic composition. In contrast to typical values used in inverse models of atmospheric CH4 for northern wetland sources ( d13 CCH4 = -58%, 14 C age modern), which have not included northern lake ebullition as a source, we show that this large, new source of high- latitude CH4 from lakes is isotopically distinct ( d13 CCH4 = -70%, 14 C age 16,500 years, for North Siberian lakes).					; Chapin, F/AAZ-3931-2020; Schuur, Edward/ACG-9944-2022; Zimov, Sergey/JCD-7517-2023	Chapin III, F Stuart/0000-0002-2558-9910; Zimov, Sergey/0000-0002-0053-6599; 													2169-8953	2169-8961				AUG 2	2008	113								G00A08	10.1029/2007JG000569	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2007JG000569													WOS:000258154000001

Diel Littoral-Pelagic Movements by Juvenile Bluegills in a Small Lake	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Diel littoral-pelagic migrations by juvenile fish have been suggested as a mechanism that optimizes the trade-off between predation risk and foraging return in open-water habitats. However, previous study designs have not been able to conclusively demonstrate this behavior in the field. We applied a horizontally oriented hydroacoustic transducer, set at the open-water edge of littoral vegetation, to observe diel fish behavior during two summers in Ridge Lake, Illinois, where the fish community is dominated by Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides and Bluegills Lepomis macrochirus. Based on acoustically tracked targets, most juvenile fish moved away from vegetated habitat at night and towards vegetation during the day. A greater number of predator-sized fish were observed in the open water during the day than at night and weak acoustic targets, most likely zooplankton, were more abundant in the open-water habitat at night. Therefore, it is likely that the reduced predator abundance and/or activity combined with potentially greater food availability in the open-water habitat prompted an offshore migration at night that was reversed after sunrise. Diel horizontal migration patterns could affect the timing and location of interspecific interactions in systems where they occur and further research is needed to determine whether diel migrations alter ecosystem function.Received September 20, 2013; accepted December 11, 2013					Shoup, Daniel/A-9869-2013; Boswell, Kevin/B-6380-2016; boswell, kevin/B-6380-2016	Shoup, Daniel/0000-0002-9867-4497; boswell, kevin/0000-0002-2037-1541													0002-8487	1548-8659				MAY 4	2014	143	3					796	801		10.1080/00028487.2014.880743	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00028487.2014.880743													WOS:000335211300012

Arctic chaff Salvelinus alpinus underwent phenological and ontogenetic habitat shifts between the epibenthic and pelagic zones in five Norwegian study lakes. Juveniles exploited epibenthic areas until they reached a body length of 13-18 cm when many moved into pelagic waters during summer. 2. Pelagic juvenile Arctic charr had larger age-specific lengths than their epibenthic counterparts, and few juvenile Arctic chaff moved from epibenthic to pelagic areas in the presence of large brown trout, the main potential fish predator present. 3. The mean size of the smallest Arctic chaff in the uppermost 2 Secchi disc units of the pelagic area was positively correlated with the body size of the largest brown trout that were present, and with the water transparency of the lakes. The size of pelagic charr declined significantly with depth in all but one lake. 4. Our results indicate that juvenile Arctic charr demonstrate a trade-off between food demand and presence of predators, and thereby distribute themselves according to food availability and risk of predation.

Taking a customer perspective, it determines the requirements for an application with the ability to optimize personal mobility. Design/methodology/approach - A quantitative study and a survey of focus groups were conducted to identify movement patterns of different types of visitors and their requirements concerning the development of a visitor management application. Findings - Visitors want an application that provides real-time forecasts of issues such as traffic, parking and queues and, at the same time, enables them to create a personal activity schedule based on this information. Research limitations/implications - Not every subsample reached a sufficient number of cases to yield representative results. Practical implications - The results may lead to an optimization and management separation of mobility flows in the research area and be helpful to municipal planners, destination marketing organizations and visitors. Originality/value - The German border cities of Konstanz, Radolfzell and Singen in the Lake Constance region need improved visitor management, mainly because of a high level of shopping tourism by Swiss visitors to Germany. In the Summer months, Lake Constance is also a popular destination for leisure tourists, which causes overtourism. For the first time, the results of this research presented here offer possible solutions, in particular by showing how a mobile application for visitors could defuse the situation.

Cyclic heliothermal behaviour of the shallow, hypersaline Lake Hayward, Western Australia	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Lake Hayward is one of only about 30 hypersaline lakes worldwide that is meromictic and heliothermal and as such behaves as a natural salt gradient solar pond. Lake Hayward acts as a local groundwater sink, resulting in seasonally variable hypersaline lake water with total dissolved solids (TDS) in the upper layer (mixolimnion) ranging between 56 kg m(-3) and 207 kg m(-3) and the deeper layer (monimolimnion) from 153 kg m(-3) to 211 kg m(-3). This is up to six times the salinity of seawater and thus has the highest salinity of all eleven lakes in the Yalgorup National Park lake system. A program of continuously recorded water temperature profiles has shown that salinity stratification initiated by direct rainfall onto the lake's surface and local runoff into the lake results in the onset of heliothermal conditions within hours of rainfall onset. The lake alternates between being fully mixed and becoming thermally and chemically stratified several times during the annual cycle, with the longest extended periods of heliothermal behaviour lasting 23 and 22 weeks in the winters of 1992 and 1993 respectively. The objective was to quantify the heat budgets of the cyclical heliothermal behaviour of Lake Hayward. During the period of temperature profile logging, the maximum recorded temperature of the monimolimnion was 42.6 degrees C at which time the temperature of the mixolimnion was 29.4 degrees C. The heat budget of two closed heliothermal cycles initiated by two rainfall events of 50 mm and 52 mm in 1993 were analysed. The cycles prevailed for 11 and 20 days respectively and the heat budget showed net heat accumulations of 34.2 MJ m(-3) and 15.4 MJ m(-3), respectively. The corresponding efficiencies of lake heat gain to incident solar energy were 0.17 and 0.18 respectively. Typically, artificial salinity gradient solar ponds (SGSP) have a solar radiation capture efficiencies ranging from 0.10 up to 0.30. Results from Lake Hayward have implications for comparative biogeochemistry and its characteristics should aid in identification of other hitherto unknown heliothermal lakes.					; Rosen, Michael/D-6091-2015; Turner, Jeffrey Vaughan/F-1306-2013; Woodbury, Robert/I-7936-2013; Turner, Jeffrey/F-1306-2013	Rosen, Michael/0000-0003-3991-0522; Turner, Jeffrey Vaughan/0000-0001-6845-9940; Woodbury, Robert/0000-0003-2884-9279; 													0022-1694	1879-2707				MAY	2018	560						495	511		10.1016/j.jhydrol.2018.03.056	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2018.03.056													WOS:000430882300038
J	Li, G; Xiao, K; Wang, QQ; Zhang, Y; Li, HT; Li, HL				Li, Gang; Xiao, Kai; Wang, Qianqian; Zhang, Yan; Li, Haitao; Li, Hailong			The Regulating Role of Meteorology in the Wetland-Air CO2 Fluxes at the Largest Shallow Grass-Type Lake on the North China Plain	WATER												Lakes are hot spots of carbon cycles in inland aquatic systems. As a vital factor, meteorology, including air temperature, precipitation, wind speed and evapotranspiration, is profoundly affecting or even regulating the wetland-air CO2 exchanges. Compared with some other similar lakes in China, the largest shallow grass-type Baiyangdian Lake (BYDL) acts as a vital CO2 sink on the North China Plain. The purpose of this study is to reveal the effects of meteorology on the process of CO2 flux variation. Based on the method of the eddy covariance, the daily average wetland-air CO2 flux at the BYDL over the monitoring period from April 2019 to November 2020, reached -0.63 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), and the annual average reached -0.71 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) from 12 April 2019 to 12 April 2020. The CO2 sink fluxes varied with the seasons and reached the maximum in summer. Temperature and evapotranspiration are two major driving factors, whose higher values can positively improve the wetland CO2 sinks. Precipitation generally coincides with the CO2 sinks, but the relatively larger summertime precipitation (0.39 m in 2020, compared with that of 0.17 m in 2019) inhibits the CO2 uptakes on longer timescales. A moderate wind speed in the range of 1.6 similar to 3.3 m s(-1), promoted the CO2 sinks for the shallow grass-type lake. Compared with previous studies at the same or similar wetlands, consistent CO2 sink fluxes are found. Further in this study, the variation trends of CO2 sinks with the changing meteorological factors are revealed for the first time in this type of wetland. Once meteorology is determined under both the anthropogenic and climatic impacts, the evaluation and prediction of the lacustrine carbon cycling could be more precise. Generally, this study will serve as an important data point into the global understanding of lake carbon fluxes.					; Wang, Qianqian/GYU-4174-2022; Li, Hailong/LJK-8752-2024	Li, Gang/0000-0001-9506-7352; 														2073-4441				JAN	2023	15	1							139	10.3390/w15010139	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w15010139													WOS:000908734300001
J	Brothers, SM; Hilt, S; Meyer, S; Köhler, J				Brothers, Soren M.; Hilt, Sabine; Meyer, Stephanie; Koehler, Jan			Plant community structure determines primary productivity in shallow, eutrophic lakes	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Regime shifts are commonly associated with the loss of submerged macrophytes in shallow lakes; yet, the effects of this on whole-lake primary productivity remain poorly understood. This study compares the annual gross primary production (GPP) of two shallow, eutrophic lakes with different plant community structures but similar nutrient concentrations. Daily GPP rates were substantially higher in the lake containing submerged macrophytes (58623gCm(-2)year(-1)) than in the lake featuring only phytoplankton and periphyton (40823gCm(-2)year(-1); P<0.0001). Comparing lake-centre diel oxygen curves to compartmental estimates of GPP confirmed that single-site oxygen curves may provide unreliable estimates of whole-lake GPP. The discrepancy between approaches was greatest in the macrophyte-dominated lake during the summer, with a high proportion of GPP occurring in the littoral zone. Our empirical results were used to construct a simple conceptual model relating GPP to nutrient availability for these alternative ecological regimes. This model predicted that lakes featuring submerged macrophytes may commonly support higher rates of GPP than phytoplankton-dominated lakes, but only within a moderate range of nutrient availability (total phosphorus ranging from 30 to 100gL(-1)) and with mean lake depths shallower than 3 or 4m. We conclude that shallow lakes with a submerged macrophyte-epiphyton complex may frequently support a higher annual primary production than comparable lakes that contain only phytoplankton and periphyton. We thus suggest that a regime shift involving the loss of submerged macrophytes may decrease the primary productivity of many lakes, with potential consequences for the entire food webs of these ecosystems.

J	Wang, C; Li, KM; Yuan, CX				Wang, Chao; Li, Kaiming; Yuan, Chunxia			Study of the effects of land use change on water yield in the Qilian Mountains in western China	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												The Qilian Mountains serve as significant ecological security barriers in the western region of China. Their continuous and stable water supply is essential for the sustainability of the human oasis in the Hexi Corridor, as well as for the maintenance of the desert ecosystem in the north. In the past three decades, land use in this area has changed significantly because of human activities, which has had a profound impact on water yield services. Based on the Water Yield module of the InVEST model, we evaluated the area and water yield of land use during 1990---2020, and discussed the characteristics of water yield response to changes in land use. As a result of the study, it was found that in the Qilian Mountains during the period 1990---2020: (1) the areas of swamp, unused land, medium coverage grassland, and woodland reduced, while the areas of high coverage grassland, low coverage grassland, cultivated land, construction land, glaciers, and water area increased, and each land use type exhibited a different degree of transformation. (2) In terms of total water yield, this declined by 1.09 x 108 m3, water yield of medium coverage grasslands, unused land, and swamp decreased, while water yield of other land uses increased, however, the responses to the change in water yield as a result of the change in land use were significant. (3) The areas with decreased water yield fall mainly within the high-altitude areas of the Qinghai Lake and Qaidam river watersheds, while the low-altitude areas were characterized by an increase in water yield. This study may provide decision-makers with guidance for protecting the ecosystem of the Qilian Mountains and developing a national park in the Qilian Mountains.

J	Kadlec, RH; Bevis, FB				Kadlec, Robert H.; Bevis, Frederick B.			Wastewater treatment at the Houghton Lake wetland: Vegetation response	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												This paper describes the vegetation responses in a very long-running study of the capacity of a natural peatland to remove nutrients from treated wastewater. Data are here presented and analyzed from three decades of full-scale operation, during which large changes in the plant communities occurred. An average of 600,000 m(3) year(-1) of treated wastewater was discharged seasonally (May 1-October 31) to the Porter Ranch peatland near the community of Houghton Lake, Michigan. This discharge was seasonal, commencing no sooner than May 1 and ending no later than October 31. During the winter half-year, treated wastewater was stored at the lagoon site. This water contained 3.5 mg/L of total phosphorus, and 7 mg/L of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN). Nutrients were stored in the 100 ha irrigation area, which removed 94% of the phosphorus (53 metric tons) and 95% of the dissolved inorganic nitrogen. Phosphorus was stored in new biomass, increased soil sorption, and accretion of new soils and sediments, with accretion being dominant. The irrigation area underwent large changes in ecosystem structure, in which the original plant communities were displaced by Typha spp. There was an initial fertilizer response, characterized by much larger standing crops of vegetation, at about triple the crop in control areas. Increased biomass was accompanied by increases in tissue nitrogen and phosphorus content, by factors of two and three, respectively. The plant community shift, from the initial sedge-willow and leatherleaf-bog birch cover types to a cattail-dominant cover type, progressed to a 83-ha area over the 30-year period of record (POR). The interior portion of this new cattail patch became a floating mat. There were large gradients in stem densities and stem heights within the impacted area. The response times of the vegetative community shifts were on the order of 10 years for 63% of the final impact zone development. The grow-in time for development of a new larger standing crop in the discharge zone was also 10 years. The impacted area was stable at the 30-year time, without any further moving fronts. Around the cattail zone, there were fringe areas that contained a mixture of the original cover types intruded by relatively small amounts of cattail. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

With the invasion of cold air from Lake Baikal (107 degrees E, 53 degrees N), the arid area in the southeast of Mongolia (107 degrees-108 degrees E, 47 degrees-48 degrees N) was in a region with a large potential pseudo-equivalent temperature gradient, where interactions between cold and warm air led to instability of the atmospheric stratification, and became the dust source area. Meanwhile, a low-pressure cyclone formed over the area (122.3 degrees E, 47.5 degrees N) to the east of the dust source area. Under the joint action of the westerlies, the cyclone developed and supplied forces to the vertical ascent and transportation of dust. Strong winds carried the dust along the southeast direction to China. As the cyclone strengthened, the cold and humid air from Lake Baikal arrived and supplied water vapor for precipitation over Beijing. On the whole, the low-pressure cyclone provided momentum and water vapor for this dust-precipitation event. It is found that the horizontal helicity belt can be an indicator for the prediction of the dust transport pathway. The quick increase in surface dust concentration to its peak was closely related to the increase in downward movements in the layers above 700 hPa.

Aspects of population dynamics and feeding by piscivorous birds in the intermittently open Riet River estuary, Eastern Cape, South Africa	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC SCIENCE												Aspects of the population dynamics and feeding activity of piscivorous birds in the small (c. 5 ha) intermittently open Riet River estuary, on the south-eastern coastline of South Africa, were investigated monthly from August 2005 to July 2006. A total of 188 birds of 13 species were recorded, of which six were wading piscivores, four aerial divers and three were pursuit swimmers. The Reed Cormorant (Phalacrocorax africanus) was the numerically dominant species, with a mean of 8.25 (SD +/- 7.90) individuals per count. Mean numbers of the Pied Kingfisher (Ceryle rudis) and Giant Kingfisher (Megaceryle maximus) were 3.42 (SD +/- 1.20) and 1.17 (SD +/- 0.60) individuals per count, respectively. The remaining 10 species revealed mean values 0.5 individuals per count. Breaching events were associated with a change in feeding groups from waders to pursuit feeders, and a decrease in total bird numbers, most likely due to loss of potential littoral zone foraging habitat for waders resulting from reduced water levels. The highest bird numbers were recorded in winter reflecting the migration of large numbers of Reed Cormorant into the system. Monthly food consumption by all piscivorous birds showed large temporal variability, ranging from 26.35 to 140.58 kg per month.

These studies are particularly valuable in the high latitudes, regions especially vulnerable to rapid climate change and increasingly used for plant-based proxy reconstructions of past hydroclimate, but also where modern vegetation is understudied compared to the lower latitudes. Here we investigate delta H-2 values from leaf wax n-alkanes of vascular tundra plants in the Kangerlussuaq area of western Greenland. We collected a variety of common tundra species to study possible interspecies variability in delta H-2 values including dwarf shrubs (Betula nana, Empetrum hermaphroditum, Salix glauca), forbs and graminoids (Vaccinium uliginosum, Rhododendron tomentosum, and Calamagrostis lapponica), a horsetail species (Equisetum arvense), and a submerged aquatic macrophyte from a local lake (Stuckenia filiformis). Using previously measured leaf and stem waters to help constrain potential drivers of leaf wax n-alkane delta H-2 values, we find that the overall net fractionation (epsilon(app)) from the studied species is -75 +/- 20%. The eapp at Kangerlussuaq is consistent with other studies of Arctic vegetation that find smaller eapp than from the majority of lower latitude sites. The fractionation of leaf water and xylem water (epsilon(lw/xw)) and the fractionation of xylem water and precipitation (epsilon(xw/p)) are both relatively constant, suggesting stable leaf and soil related fractionations across species. Estimates of biosynthetic fractionation (epsilon(bio)), as evidenced from the fractionation of the delta H-2 values of n-alkanes and leaf water (epsilon(wax/ lw)), are not constant across species as sometimes assumed, and are small (average of ebio is -120 +/- 27%) compared to many published estimates. This supports a significant role in ebio shaping the eapp in this high latitude setting, where lipid biosynthesis may be driving differences in n-alkane delta H-2 values. This finding suggests that lipids in the Kangerlussuaq plants studied rely on the use of some proportion of different hydrogen sources during lipid synthesis, such as stored NADPH. The cumulative results of this survey of Kangerlussuaq area n-alkane delta H-2 values and water-wax fractionations suggest that fractionation in the high latitudes during the short summer growing season may play an important role in governing the small eapp compared to many low latitude sites. Better understanding of appropriate eapp and the importance of ebio in controlling plant wax fractionation from the high latitudes is necessary for future reconstructions of hydroclimate using leaf wax delta H-2 values in these regions.

The life cycle of the coastal population, which was reflected in their pattern of lipid storage, was coupled closely to the growth of sea ice. Nauplii entered the sea ice in early autumn and overwintered predominantly as the NIV stage, with triacylglycerol comprising up to 26 % of their dry weight (DW). During their rapid development from stages CI to CIV, much smaller quantities (<2% DW) of triacylglycerol were present. The population underwent a habitat shift from the ice to the water column at the CIV stage, although adults remained close to the ice-water interface. Adults of both sexes initially contained high amounts of triacylglycerol as a proportion of their total lipid (50 % in males, 65 % in females), but these stores were depleted over the 3 wk-long period of mating and spawning. The lacustrine population of P. antarctica also accumulated triacylglycerol; however, their life cycle was largely independent of the ice cover on the lake. The CI to CIV stages of the lacustrine population contained more triacylglycerol than the same stages at the coastal site, suggesting that either they experienced short-term periods of starvation due to patchiness in the food supply or that their dietary intake was lipid-rich. Reproduction began 1 mo earlier in the lake population, and the lipid storage patterns of adults indicated a longer reproductive duration. The fatty acid composition of P. antarctica reflected that of particulate matter in the 2 environments, arguing for a relatively simple biochemical pathway in comparison to some of the larger pelagic copepods.					; Nichols, Peter/C-5128-2011	Swadling, Kerrie/0000-0002-7620-841X; 													0171-8630						2000	208						171	182		10.3354/meps208171	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/meps208171													WOS:000166447900014

Analyses were performed for copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), manganese (Mn), iron (Fe), cobalt (Co), magnesium (Mg), nickel (Ni), chrome (Cr) and boron (B) using inductively coupled plasma-optic emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES), and cadmium (Cd) using atomic absorption spectrophotometer (AAS) utilizing microwave digestion techniques. The concentrations of the heavy metals found in the fish varied in the follow ing ranges: Cu: < DL-7.04, Zn: 6.96-357.25, Mn: < DL-20.70, Ni: < DL-6.21, Fe: 9.62-2500.33, Cr: < DL-1.74, Co: < DL-0.54, Cd: 0.01-0.27 and Mg: 197.44-904.90 mg/kg wet weight. While B had the second highest concentration in the water of the lake, it was not encountered in any tissue of the investigated species. In all tissues and the species, While the bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) of Mn, Zn, Fe and Cu were remarkably high, the BAFs of Mg, Cr, Co, and B were also fairly low or none. Although the heavy metal accumulation levels for the muscle were generally lower than other tissues, there were some exceptions. Cd level in the muscle of C. carassius was higher than the permissible limit stated by Turkish legislation, FAO and WHO. The mean metal amounts for all the investigated tissues and species are statistically compared and discussed in this study.					; AY, Cigdem/AAE-3901-2021; Erdoğan, Yunus Emre/AAC-5534-2022; Ozmal, Ferda/KVY-3924-2024; Özmal, Ferda/KVY-3924-2024	AY, CIGDEM/0000-0002-8283-0678; Bulbul, Metin/0000-0002-4722-447X; Ozmal, Ferda/0000-0002-8393-5279; 													0167-6369	1573-2959				OCT	2009	157	1-4					355	362		10.1007/s10661-008-0540-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-008-0540-y								18843546					WOS:000269883900031

Observations of Buried Lake Drainage on the Antarctic Ice Sheet	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Between 1992 and 2017, the Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS) lost ice equivalent to 7.6 +/- 3.9 mm of sea level rise. AIS mass loss is mitigated by ice shelves that provide a buttress by regulating ice flow from tributary glaciers. However, ice-shelf stability is threatened by meltwater ponding, which may initiate, or reactivate preexisting, fractures, currently poorly understood processes. Here, through ground penetrating radar (GPR) analysis over a buried lake in the grounding zone of an East Antarctic ice shelf, we present the first field observations of a lake drainage event in Antarctica via vertical fractures. Concurrent with the lake drainage event, we observe a decrease in surface elevation and an increase in Sentinel-1 backscatter. Finally, we suggest that fractures that are initiated or reactivated by lake drainage events in a grounding zone will propagate with ice flow onto the ice shelf itself, where they may have implications for its stability. Plain Language Summary The Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS) is losing mass, thereby contributing to sea level rise. Ice shelves, which are thick floating layers of glacier ice extending from the glaciers on land, buttress much of the AIS and protect it from even more mass loss. The stability of these ice shelves is threatened by meltwater ponds that form during the summer and may cause ice shelves to break up. Here, we present field observations from Antarctica of a buried meltwater lake drainage via vertical fractures. To detect the drainage event, we use radar observations collected in the field, along with surface height changes and radar images from satellites, from both before and after the drainage event. Our study improves the understanding of meltwater processes on Antarctic ice shelves, and implications of those processes on ice-shelf stability.					; Pattyn, Frank/AAA-9640-2019; Drews, Reinhard/AAP-4134-2021; Banwell, Alison/W-8180-2018; Shragge, Jeffrey/A-9275-2009; Lhermitte, Stef (Stefaan)/A-3385-2013; Lenaerts, Jan/D-9423-2012	Wever, Nander/0000-0002-4829-8585; Willis, Ian/0000-0002-0750-7088; Dunmire, Devon/0000-0001-6299-9137; Drews, Reinhard/0000-0002-2328-294X; Banwell, Alison/0000-0001-9545-829X; Hansen, Jasmine/0000-0002-9515-2642; Keenan, Eric/0000-0002-1511-9093; Shragge, Jeffrey/0000-0002-1986-0399; Lenaerts, Jan/0000-0003-4309-4011; Miller, Julie Z./0000-0003-1452-1627; Pattyn, Frank/0000-0003-4805-5636; Lhermitte, Stef/0000-0002-1622-0177													0094-8276	1944-8007				AUG 16	2020	47	15							e2020GL087970	10.1029/2020GL087970	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2020GL087970								32999516					WOS:000560376100011

Underweight in ski jumping:: The solution of the problem	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE												Underweight is becoming increasingly prevalent in many sports. Among world class ski jumpers, the body mass index BMI has decreased by 4 units since 1970. The BMI ignores different body properties of individuals. Particular care should be taken in groups with unusual leg length to avoid classifying them inappropriately as thin or overweight (WHO). The improved measure MI (mass index) for relative body weight overcomes this shortcoming. Anthropometric data of ski jumpers was collected during the Olympic Games in Salt Lake City (2002; participation 81%, n = 57), during the Summer Grand Prix in Hinterzarten (2000; participation 100%, n = 92), and during the World Cup in Planica (2000; n = 56). The BMI and the MI were determined. The MI considers the individual leg length: A person with longer legs than average has an MI > BMI, and vice versa: MI = 0.28 m/s(2) (m: mass in kg, s: sitting height in meters). BMI classes of ski jumpers in the season 2004/2005 were calculated from their official individual ski length limitation which is a function of their BMI. BMI means were 19.84 in Planica, 19.58 in Hinterzarten, and 19.43 kgm(-2) in SLC. Lowest BMI was 16.4 kgm(-2). The percentage of underweight ski jumpers (BMI < 18.5 kgm(-2)) decreased from 22.8% at the Olympic Games 2002 to 8.7% in the season 2004/2005 due to the new ski jumping regulations. The ratio s/h = C (s = sitting height, h = height, C = cormic index) ranged from 0.49 to 0.57. Accordingly, the MI values (which are leg length corrected BMI values according to MI = BMI ((C) over bar /C)(k) with k = 2 and (C) over bar = 0.53) deviated remarkably from BMI values. For the 49 cases with BMI or MI or both below 18.5 kgm(-2), the classification to be underweight or not changed in 69% when the MI was used instead of the BMI. Underweight or overweight is not only a question of cut-off points; the measure used determines the classification accuracy. A substantial improvement of weight analyses in sports medicine, public health, and general medicine as well can be obtained by using the MI instead of the BMI.

While the greenhouse gas emission of reservoirs has received a lot of attention, there is a lack of studies focusing on OC burial. In particular, there are no studies on reservoir OC burial in the Amazon, even though hydropower is expanding in the basin. Here we present results from the first investigation of OC burial and CH4 concentrations in the sediments of an Amazonian hydroelectric reservoir. We performed sub-bottom profiling, sediment coring and sediment pore water analysis in the Curua Una (CUN) reservoir (Amazon, Brazil) during rising- and falling-water periods. The spatially resolved average sediment accumulation rate was 0.6 cm yr(-1), and the average OC burial rate was 91 g Cm-2 yr(-1). This is the highest OC burial rate on record for low-latitude hydroelectric reservoirs. Such a high rate probably results from a high OC deposition onto the sediment, which compensates the high OC mineralization at a 28-30 degrees C water temperature. Elevated OC burial was found near the dam and close to major river inflow areas. C : N ratios between 10.3 and 17 (average +/- SD: 12 :9 +/- 2 :1) suggest that both land-derived and aquatic OC accumulate in CUN sediments. About 23% of the sediment pore water samples had dissolved CH4 above the saturation concentration. This represents a higher share than in other hydroelectric reservoirs, indicating a high potential for CH4 ebullition, particularly in river inflow areas.

J	Brodersen, KP; Anderson, NJ				Brodersen, KP; Anderson, NJ			Distribution of chironomids (Diptera) in low arctic West Greenland lakes: trophic conditions, temperature and environmental reconstruction	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Surface sediment samples of subfossil chironomid head capsules from 47 lakes in southern West Greenland were analysed using multivariate numerical methods in order to explore the relationship between chironomid assemblages and selected environmental variables. The study lakes are located along a climate gradient ranging from coastal maritime conditions near the Davis Strait to a continental climate near the margin of the Greenland ice sheet. 2. High-resolution surface water temperatures were measured through the summer season using automatic data loggers in 21 of the study lakes. The mean July surface water temperature (1999) ranged from 7.3 to 16.5 degreesC in the data set. 3. In all lakes, a total of 24 chironomid taxa were recorded; Micropsectra, Psectrocladius, Chironomus and Procladius were the dominant genera. There was a strong correlation between the trophic variables [total nitrogen and total phosphorus (TN, TP)] and temperature, and in redundancy analysis (RDA) the three variables explained almost equal significant amounts of variation in the chironomid data (19.8-22.3%). However, temperature lost significant explanatory power when the effect of TN was partialled out in RDA. 4. The lakes were classified using two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN) into eight groups defined by temperature, trophic variables, salinity (conductivity) and lake-morphometric data. Fourteen chironomid taxa showed significant differences in percentage abundances among groups, with Heterotrissocladius, Micropsectra, Ablabesmyia and Chironomus as the most robust group-indicator taxa. Forward selection of taxa in multiple discriminant analysis was used to fit chironomid assemblages into lake groups. Using only eight taxa, 95% of lakes were correctly classified at a second TWINSPAN division level (four groups) and 85% of lakes at a third division level (eight groups). 5. This study showed that there is considerable potential in using subfossil chironomid head capsules as paleoenvironmental indicators in both short- and long-term (down-core) studies of lake ontogeny and palaeoclimate conditions in West Greenland. However, because of the strong correlation between temperature and trophic variables, a quantitative reconstruction of lake- and habitat-type is recommended, in combination with direct reconstruction of single variables such as temperature.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				JUN	2002	47	6					1137	1157		10.1046/j.1365-2427.2002.00831.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.2002.00831.x													WOS:000175729900007

Thermal biology of aquatic insects in alpine lakes: Insights from diving beetles	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												High mountain areas are especially vulnerable to global warming, as they experience faster temperature changes than lowlands in a climate change context. Notably, increased temperatures and frequency of extreme flooding and droughts, and the consequent decrease in ice cover and water availability fluctuations, will induce important physical changes in alpine freshwater systems. Thus, assessing thermal limits and exploring overwintering strategies of aquatic alpine insects is pivotal to understanding how aquatic communities of high-mountain fresh waters will respond to climate change. However, knowledge on these topics is still scarce for aquatic alpine insects.Here, the thermal biology of adults of five diving beetle species from alpine lakes located in the Sierra Nevada mountain range (southern Iberia) was studied. Cold tolerance was measured estimating the supercooling point (SCP), lower lethal temperature (LLT), tolerance to ice enclosure and to submersion, whereas heat tolerance was assessed from the heat coma temperature and upper lethal temperature.All of the species survived ice enclosure for 3 h. Furthermore, three of the studied species had SCPs higher than their LLTs, suggesting that they could be freeze-tolerant. All species except Agabus nevadensis also were tolerant to submersion, which could be a key adaptation for overwintering underwater below the ice cover as adults, reducing risk from freezing conditions in the air. The species did not differ significantly in their upper thermal limits, which were similar to those of other dytiscids from lower altitudes.Overall, our results suggest that increasing temperatures is not expected to be the most important threat for the water beetle populations in Sierra Nevada, but rather the colonisation of alpine lakes by lowland dytiscids in a warmer climate scenario.

J	Gervais, F				Gervais, F			Diel vertical migration of Cryptomonas and Chromatium in the deep chlorophyll maximum of a eutrophic lake	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Large populations of the phytoflagellates Cryptomonas rostratiformis, Cryptornonas phaseolus, Cryptomonas undulata and the phototrophic bacterium Chromatium cf. okenii have been observed in the oxic/anoxic boundary layer of the slightly eutrophic, dimictic lake Schlachtensee during the summer stratification. Vertical distribution of these populations was studied with the help of a new close-interval sampler and by in situ fluorescence measurements with fine spatial (cm to dm) and temporal(h) resolution on 4 days in 1991, 1994 and 1995. All populations lived close to the chemocline but showed a regular diel vertical migration with daytime ascent and night-time descent and a low migration amplitude. At least for one species-C.rostratiformis-the pattern of migration suggests that this behaviour has an endogenous origin. As a result of diel vertical migration, the population of C.rostratiformis was spatially separated from the other dominating populations during daytime. Ultimate cause of diel vertical migration was a better light supply of all populations. Another probable advantage was the reduction in grazing pressure, as large percentages of all populations moved into the anoxic, hydrogen sulphide containing water layers during night-time.																			0142-7873					MAY	1997	19	5					533	550		10.1093/plankt/19.5.533	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/19.5.533													WOS:A1997XA34300001

River-to-Lake Transitional Areas Contribute Disproportionately to In-Lake Nutrient Loading	OCEAN-LAND-ATMOSPHERE RESEARCH												River-to-lake transitional areas are biogeochemically active sections of the aquatic continuum that are often understudied compared to their adjoining environments. Internal nutrient loading from river-to-lake transitional areas may be a considerable source of nutrients to lakes and if overlooked disconnect upstream management initiatives from in-lake improvements. To contextualize internal nutrient loading by river-to-lake sediments, we conducted sediment core incubations and nutrient assays at 3 time points over a field season from a major contributing tributary of Lake Erie. Using statistical and spatial interpolation models, we upscaled internal nitrogen and phosphorus loading rates across the highly impaired mouth of the Maumee River, which drains into the western basin of Lake Erie. We found that internal nutrient dynamics in this river-to-lake transitional area were regulated by spatial differences in the physical composition and nutrient and organic matter contents of sediments. The Maumee river-to-lake transitional area was largely a source of phosphorus and ammonium nitrogen and a sink of nitrate nitrogen through high denitrification rates. Yet, we observed substantial temporal variation whereby internal nutrient loading was greatest in late summer coinciding with near-zero denitrification. Sediments at this time could contribute an additional similar to 17% more soluble reactive phosphorus and similar to 3% more total kjeldahl nitrogen in the bioavailable ammonium nitrogen fraction relative to the daily external nutrient load. High internal nutrient loading rates compared to more offshore areas in western Lake Erie suggest that this degraded river-to-lake transitional area has a disproportional biogeochemical significance and a high potential to contribute to nearshore water quality issues.

J	Kato, H; Kohzu, A; Nishihiro, J				Kato, Hiroki; Kohzu, Ayato; Nishihiro, Jun			Relationship between nitrogen removal and habitat provisioning functions of small wetlands originated from abandoned paddy fields: multisite comparison and experimental verification	LANDSCAPE AND ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Although wetlands serve various ecological functions, the relationships among the functions remain unclear. From an ecological perspective, abandoned rice paddies may function as wetlands. We analyzed the relationship between the ecological functions of nitrogen removal from surface water and habitat provisioning to wetland plants in 32 wetlands that originated from abandoned rice paddies in the catchment of Lake Inbanuma, Japan. Results of a principal component analysis suggested that these functions can be synergistic in wetlands with a greater rate of spring water discharge, water depth, and canopy openness. The importance of water depth for both functions was also revealed by generalized linear models. We conducted an experimental restoration in a dry abandoned rice paddy in which the surface water depth was increased by damming an artificial drainage channel. After the restoration, the nitrate ion concentration at the outlet of the site had declined by half. Furthermore, seven endangered wetland species were re-established from the propagule banks. Our results suggest that through improvement of the hydrological condition of abandoned paddy fields, they can become wetlands that contribute to water quality management and biodiversity conservation.																			1860-1871	1860-188X				JAN	2025	21	1					163	174		10.1007/s11355-024-00631-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11355-024-00631-8		DEC 2024											WOS:001370704900001
J	Olim, E; Lora, JM; Battalio, JM				Olim, Ethan; Lora, Juan M.; Battalio, J. Michael			Methane storm characteristics and evolution in simulations of Titan's hydroclimate	ICARUS												Methane precipitation is a key component of the climate on Titan, and has been shown to impact surface features. Recent general circulation models (GCMs) have reproduced Titan's hydroclimate, including precipitation, with increasing accuracy, yet characterization of their simulated precipitation events is lacking. We investigate the characteristics and evolution of methane storms simulated over 40 Titan years using the Titan Atmospheric Model, a validated GCM. Storms are identified and tracked using the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm, allowing them to be followed through time and space. We find that storms follow seasonality expected from observations and prior modeling, occur preferentially in the summer hemisphere, and tend to start over high topography. The population of storms is bimodal in traits corresponding to intensity, area, and duration, with a large population of small, short-lived, and weakly precipitating storms and a smaller population of exceptionally large, long-lasting, and intense storms. These largest storms tend to evolve similarly over their lifetimes, peaking early in intensity and in the middle of their lives in area. We also find temporal clustering of storms, in alignment with observations and the proposed relaxation-oscillation model of Titan's methane precipitation. These storm clusters emerge quasi- periodically following long dry spells during which evaporation of surface methane recharges atmospheric moisture. Approximately five clusters occur per Titan year, and their locations are strongly seasonal. Overall, our quantitative descriptions of storms and storm clusters over a long timescale provide additional insight into Titan's methane cycle and surface features, and may assist in the planning of future missions such as Dragonfly. .

Results are reported here on photosynthetic rates, primary productivity and associated parameters of phytoplankton from a polymictic, groundwater seepage lake in an urban environment before, during and after restoration measures. In addition, a simple regression model is presented to approximate daily column production from column integrated chlorophyll-a measurements. Calculated and estimates phytoplankton annual lake production is compared to production by submerged vascular plants. Results indicate that macrophytes played an essential role during the clear water phase preceding the eutrophication phase associated with intense algal productivity and vanishing submersed plant production. Internal restoration measures led to rapidly decreasing phytoplankton production and slowly re-appearing macrophytes. The rehabilitation phase following this period was characterized by declining phytoplankton productivity and re-establishing of macrophyte production. Total lake production as the sum of phytoplankton and macrophyte production declined from 626 t C to 186 t C during 1993-1996 mainly as a result of declining plankton production. During rehabilitation phytoplankton production further declined and macrophyte production regained importance. The interannual variability was ascribed to changes in the winter North Atlantic Oscillation Index. The index significantly correlated with lake production explaining 48% of the variability.					; Dokulil, Martin/J-3464-2019	Dokulil, Martin/0000-0002-6369-1457; 													1573-4595	2543-005X	978-3-319-93270-5; 978-3-319-93268-2				2018	10						149	162		10.1007/978-3-319-93270-5_10	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-93270-5_10	10.1007/978-3-319-93270-5												WOS:000459447700010

Thiamine deficiency and the effectiveness of thiamine treatments through broodstock injections and egg immersion on Lake Ontario steelhead trout	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												In fall 2014, steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) migrating in the Salmon River, New York, exhibited abnormal swimming behavior and, in some cases, mortality as reported by sport fishermen. Preliminary results showed that affected individuals had low levels of thiamine in their muscle and liver. As a result, New York State Department of Conservation (NYSDEC) personnel from the Salmon River Fish Hatchery injected adult fish with thiamine mononitrate (50 mg/kg). In April 2015, muscle, liver, and eggs were taken from adults treated (n = 27) or not (n = 27) with thiamine at the Salmon River Fish Hatchery to evaluate their thiamine concentration. In addition, a subsample of eggs was fertilized and treated or not with a thiamine bath (1000 ppm). Accordingly, four treatment groups were established: adults treated/eggs treated (TT), adults treated/eggs untreated (TU), adults untreated/eggs treated (UT), and adults untreated/eggs untreated (UU). Offspring mortality was significantly higher (P < 0.001) in samples from the UU treatment group compared to the other three treatment groups (TT, TU, and UT), which were not significantly different (P> 0.8) from each other. The efficiency of each treatment was compared based on offspring mortality. Significant differences in muscle, liver, and egg total thiamine concentrations were observed between treated and untreated adults (P < 0.001). The relationship between total egg thiamine concentrations and offspring mortality also suggests that steelhead trout thiamine requirements may be greater than previously expected.

In this study, the mineralogical and petrological characteristics, types of organic matter (OM), and effect of volcanism on the sedimentary environment and OM accumulation were analyzed using organic, carbon, and oxygen isotopes, as well as major and trace element data. The results revealed that the P(2)l(2) was characterized by mixed deposition of volcanic ash and carbonate minerals, with four main rock types: tuff, dolomitic tuff, tuffaceous dolomite, and dolomite. The fine-grained rocks dominantly contain type I and II1 kerogens, which were in a low-mature stage and exhibited excellent original hydrocarbon generative potential. When volcanic activity was strong, large amounts of nutrients were released by the volcanic ash, which then entered the lake, in turn promoting the blooming of phytoplankton, and causing the delta C-13 values in the tuff to decrease. In addition, the paleotemperature decreased for a short time, and the suboxiceuxinic environment was conducive to the preservation of OM, resulting in high total organic carbon (TOC) content in the tuff. In contrast, during intermittent or weak periods of volcanic activity, the climate was hotter and drier, and evaporation resulted in a sustained increase of salinity. Consequently, the growth of algae was restricted, which brought about an increase in the delta C-13 values and relatively low TOC content in the dolomite. The relationships among primary productivity, redox conditions, clastic influx proxies, and TOC content illustrate that primary productivity was the most vital control on the accumulation of OM. High primary productivity was mainly driven by volcanic ash falls. Meanwhile, high salinity and suboxic-euxinic conditions were beneficial to the preservation of OM, giving rise to a high degree of OM enrichment.																			0031-0182	1872-616X				DEC 15	2020	560								110024	10.1016/j.palaeo.2020.110024	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2020.110024													WOS:000591245000034

The carbon dynamics in the sediment was simulated by a numerical model that accounts for all basic processes controlling the concentration and isotopic composition of DIC. The remineralized carbon (DIC plus CH4) has mean delta(13)C value of -28.4 parts per thousand. The dominant carbon isotope effect expressed during early diagenesis of this organic matter is associated with methanogenesis. Methane produced at this site has a measured value of -69 parts per thousand, while DIC is enriched in C-13 (-12.6 parts per thousand) because of the preferential synthesis of (CH4)-C-12. In sediment pore water, the isotopic composition of DIC reflects the combination from degradation of organic carbon using various electron acceptors and methanogenesis. It was found that the major contribution (38-78%) of DIC is derived from methatiogenesis. The highest contribution of CaCO3 dissolution was observed in the spring (12%), characterized by lower bottom water temperatures and slower degradation of sedimentary organic matter.

Nearshore hydrodynamics as loading and forcing factors for Escherichia coli contamination at an embayed beach	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Numerical simulations of the transport and fate of Escherichia coli were conducted at Chicago's 63rd Street Beach, an embayed beach that had the highest mean E. coli concentration among 23 similar Lake Michigan beaches during summer months of 2000-2005, in order to find the cause for the high bacterial contamination. The numerical model was based on the transport of E. coli by current circulation patterns in the embayment driven by longshore main currents and the loss of E. coli in the water column, taking settling as well as bacterial dark-and solar-related decay into account. Two E. coli loading scenarios were considered: one from the open boundary north of the embayment and the other from the shallow water near the beachfront. Simulations showed that the embayed beach behaves as a sink for E. coli in that it generally receives E. coli more efficiently than it releases them. This is a result of the significantly different hydrodynamic forcing factors between the inside of the embayment and the main coastal flow outside. The settled E. coli inside the embayment can be a potential source of contamination during subsequent sediment resuspension events, suggesting that deposition-resuspension cycles of E. coli have resulted in excessive bacterial contamination of beach water. A further hypothetical case with a breakwater shortened to half its original length, which was anticipated to enhance the current circulation in the embayment, showed a reduction in E. coli concentrations of nearly 20%.					; Phanikumar, Mantha/A-2523-2008	Nevers, Meredith/0000-0001-6963-6734; Byappanahalli, Muruleedhara/0000-0001-5376-597X													0024-3590					JAN	2012	57	1					362	381		10.4319/lo.2012.57.1.0362	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2012.57.1.0362													WOS:000302612100012
J	Hodgson, DA; Convey, P				Hodgson, DA; Convey, P			A 7000-year record of oribatid mite communities on a maritime-Antarctic island: Responses to climate change	ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												We studied the fossil remains of the common Antarctic oribatid mites, Alaskozetes antarcticus and Halozetes belgicae, in sediment cores from two lakes in adjacent catchments on Signy Island, South Orkney Islands, maritime Antarctic. The aim was to examine the response of these species to 7000 yr of documented environmental change. Mites colonized the island shortly after the ice sheet retreated and habitats became available. A temperate period in the Holocene (c. 3800-1400 cal. yr BP) led to population expansion by factors of 7 (both species) in one catchment and 5.1 and 2.3 for both species in the other. This mid-Holocene hypsithermal is thought to have involved increases in habitat size, productivity, temperature, and moisture availability. Mite populations went into decline as conditions cooled. A period of short cold summers from c. 1400 cal. yr BP persisting to the middle of this century continued to impose restrictions on the biota. These results suggest that mite populations will respond positively to the recent rapid regional warming documented in the maritime Antarctic. However, on Signy Island this prediction is complicated by a similarly recent and rapid expansion of the populations of Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella), which has not occurred previously since deglaciation, damaging the mites' habitats and exerting a new set of ecological constraints.

J	Price, PB; Sowers, T				Price, PB; Sowers, T			Temperature dependence of metabolic rates for microbial growth, maintenance, and survival	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												Our work was motivated by discoveries of prokaryotic communities that survive with little nutrient in ice and permafrost with implications for past or present microbial life in Martian permafrost and Europan ice. We compared the temperature dependence of metabolic rates of microbial communities in permafrost, ice, snow, clouds, oceans, lakes, marine and freshwater sediments, and subsurface aquifer sediments. Metabolic rates per cell fall into three groupings: (i) a rate, mu(g)(T), for growth, measured in the laboratory at in situ temperatures with minimal disturbance of the medium; (ii) a rate, mu(m)(T), sufficient for maintenance of functions but for a nutrient level too low for growth; and (iii) a rate, mu(s)(T), for survival of communities imprisoned in deep glacial ice, subsurface sediment or ocean sediment, in which they can repair macromolecular damage but are probably largely dormant. The three groups have metabolic rates consistent with a single activation energy of approximate to110 U and that scale as mu(g)(T):mu(m)(T):mu(s)(T) approximate to 10(6):10(3):1. There is no evidence of a minimum temperature for metabolism. The rate at -40degreesC in ice corresponds to approximate to10 turnovers of cellular carbon per billion years. Microbes in ice and permafrost have metabolic rates similar to those in water, soil, and sediment at the same temperature. This finding supports the view that, far below the freezing point, liquid water inside ice and permafrost is available for metabolism. The rate mu(s)(T) for repairing molecular damage by means of DNA-repair enzymes and protein-repair enzymes such as methyltransferase is found to be comparable to the rate of spontaneous molecular damage.																			0027-8424	1091-6490				MAR 30	2004	101	13					4631	4636		10.1073/pnas.0400522101	http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0400522101								15070769					WOS:000220648700055

Collapse of the Tibetan Empire attributed to climatic shifts: Paleolimnological evidence from the western Tibetan Plateau	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												The Tibetan Empire, the only united regime in Tibetan history, existed between 618 and 877 CE, when Tibet was a unified world power, contesting control of Central Asia with the Tang Empire and the Abbasid Caliphate. Before its collapse in the 9th century, this was the world's highest elevation empire, ruling a vast territory that extended well beyond the Tibetan Plateau. However, factors leading to the rapid decline of this powerful highland empire remain elusive. Here we use a highly resolved lake sediment record from the western Tibetan Plateau to demonstrate that pronounced fluctuations in the climate regime between the 7th and 9th centuries played a key role in the fragmentation of the Tibetan Empire. Specifically, we demonstrate that a nearly complete shift from planktonic to benthic diatom life strategy signified markedly drier conditions and lower lake-levels. The height of the empire's power (ca. 600-800 CE) coincided with two centuries of uncharacteristically warm and humid conditions, whereas the empire's collapse (ca. 800-877 CE) co-occurred with an abrupt onset of severe drought conditions that were clearly registered in the paleolimnological records. Severe drought conditions combined with decreased social resilience might have led to rapid declines in crop production, which fostered a surge in domestic conflicts and expediated the final collapse of the Tibetan Empire. Although religious and political factors are commonly cited to explain the fall of this formidable great power, our paleoenvironmental analyses underscore that harsh environmental factors might have hastened the cultural decline of this highland region.					; Smol, John/A-8838-2015; Chen, Shengqian/ABA-5944-2021; Liu, jianbao/X-3646-2019	Chen, Zhitong/0000-0002-9142-281X; 													0277-3791	1873-457X				OCT 1	2023	317								108280	10.1016/j.quascirev.2023.108280	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quascirev.2023.108280		AUG 2023											WOS:001068908500001

It traces basin, vegetation and climate histories over the past c. 8.6 ka. The Latvia basin experienced four phases, two of which involved frequent shifts amongst lake, lagoon and bay settings (c. 8.6-7.0 cal. ka BP and c. 2.1 cal. ka BP-present). A sandbar was present between c. 7.0 and 6.9 cal. ka BP. The longest interval of Latvia basin stability was from c. 6.9-2.1 cal. ka BP when the basin was a lagoon of varying salinities. Quercus-broadleaf forests characterized the regional vegetation throughout the past c. 8.6 ka. Variations in thermophilous species (e.g. Juglans,Carpinus,Ulmus,Tilia,Syringa) and Pinus koraiensis reflect shifts in temperature and moisture during the Middle Holocene. A period of warmest climate occurred c. 8.6-5.1 cal. ka BP with wettest conditions from c. 7.5-4.3 cal. ka BP, although all changes in temperature and precipitation were gradual. The Latvia Lake results indicate that changes in Middle to Late Holocene climates were linked more closely to shifts in the East Asian Summer Monsoon and less so to sea level oscillations. This investigation demonstrates that lakes of coastal Primor'ye can provide reliable palaeovegetation and palaeoclimate records despite their changing depositional environments.

However, little information relating to late Cenozoic fire history has been gathered in mid-latitude Asia (including Inner Asia and East Asia), a key region for understanding the development of the arid-monsoon climate system as well as the driving forces behind it. Here we first report the records of microcharcoal concentrations (MC) covering the Holocene (10-0 Ica) and late Pleistocene (0.8-0 Ma), which we use to analyze the fire activity patterns at an orbital time scale; then we compile the late Cenozoic MC record to investigate the long-term fire history by analyzing four cores from the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) area, East Asia (representing 8-0 Ma) and three sites in Inner Asia (representing 18-2 Ma). The results show that the (i) MC remained higher during the relatively dry late Holocene/glacial stages than that during the humid middle Holocene/interglacial stages at individual sites; (ii) MC increased with time in both Inner Asia and East Asia after 18 and 8 Ma, respectively; and (iii) MC always remained higher in the dry Inner Asia than in the contemporaneous wet East Asia. All these characteristics imply that late Cenozoic fire occurrence in mid-latitude Asia experienced a gradual increasing trend along with the global temperature/ice volume change, and indicates a continuous aridification trend across mid-latitude Asia. The global cooling, rather than the Tibetan Plateau uplift, might have played a key role in this observed trend. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Baxter, BK				Baxter, Bonnie K.			Great Salt Lake microbiology: a historical perspective	INTERNATIONAL MICROBIOLOGY												Over geologic time, the water in the Bonneville basin has risen and fallen, most dramatically as freshwater Lake Bonneville lost enormous volume 15,000-13,000 years ago and became the modern day Great Salt Lake. It is likely that paleo-humans lived along the shores of this body of water as it shrunk to the present margins, and native peoples inhabited the surrounding desert and wetlands in recent times. Nineteenth century Euro-American explorers and pioneers described the geology, geography, and flora and fauna of Great Salt Lake, but their work attracted white settlers to Utah, who changed the lake immeasurably. Human intervention in the 1950s created two large sub-ecosystems, bisected by a railroad causeway. The north arm approaches ten times the salinity of sea water, while the south arm salinity is a meager four times that of the oceans. Great Salt Lake was historically referred to as sterile, leading to the nickname "America's Dead Sea." However, the salty brine is teaming with life, even in the hypersaline north arm. In fact, scientists have known that this lake contains a diversity of microscopic lifeforms for more than 100 years. This essay will explore the stories of the people who observed and researched the salty microbiology of Great Salt Lake, whose discoveries demonstrated the presence of bacteria, archaea, algae, and protozoa that thrive in this lake. These scientists documented the lake's microbiology as the lake changed, with input from human waste and the creation of impounded areas. Modern work on the microbiology of Great Salt Lake has added molecular approaches and illuminated the community structures in various regions, and fungi and viruses have now been described. The exploration of Great Salt Lake by scientists describing these tiny inhabitants of the brine illuminate the larger terminal lake with its many facets, anthropomorphic challenges, and ever-changing shorelines.																			1139-6709	1618-1905				SEP	2018	21	3					79	95		10.1007/s10123-018-0008-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10123-018-0008-z								30810951					WOS:000452823400001

The greening of Arabia: Multiple opportunities for human occupation of the Arabian Peninsula during the Late Pleistocene inferred from an ensemble of climate model simulations	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												Climate models are potentially useful tools for addressing human dispersals and demographic change. The Arabian Peninsula is becoming increasingly significant in the story of human dispersals out of Africa during the Late Pleistocene. Although characterised largely by arid environments today, emerging climate records indicate that the peninsula was wetter many times in the past, suggesting that the region may have been inhabited considerably more than hitherto thought. Explaining the origins and spatial distribution of increased rainfall is challenging because palaeoenvironmental research in the region is in an early developmental stage. We address environmental oscillations by assembling and analysing an ensemble of five global climate models (CCSM3, COSMOS, HadCM3, KCM, and NorESM). We focus on precipitation, as the variable is key for the development of lakes, rivers and savannas. The climate models generated here were compared with published palaeoenvironmental data such as palaeolakes, speleothems and alluvial fan records as a means of validation. All five models showed, to varying degrees, that the Arabia Peninsula was significantly wetter than today during the Last Interglacial (130 ka and 126/125 ka timeslices), and that the main source of increased rainfall was from the North African summer monsoon rather than the Indian Ocean monsoon or from Mediterranean climate patterns. Where available, 104 ka (MIS 5c), 56 ka (early MIS 3) and 21 ka (LGM) timeslices showed rainfall was present but not as extensive as during the Last Interglacial. The results favour the hypothesis that humans potentially moved out of Africa and into Arabia on multiple occasions during pluvial phases of the Late Pleistocene. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

J	Napiórkowska-Krzebietke, A				Napiorkowska-Krzebietke, Agnieszka			Cyanobacterial bloom intensity in the ecologically relevant state of lakes - an approach to Water Framework Directive implementation	OCEANOLOGICAL AND HYDROBIOLOGICAL STUDIES												This study focused on the determination of the cyanobacteria development in terms of the probabilistic recognition of the bloom intensity level in the ecologically relevant state of lakes. Assuming the possibility of using once-a-year sampling frequency, the ecological status or potential was assessed based on the modified Polish phytoplankton-based method (PMPL MOD) in 23 Masurian lakes. The summer cyanobacteria biomass reached 52.3 mg l(-1). The biomass did not exceed the WHO-defined low risk threshold of 2 mg l(-1), and was usually observed in lakes with at least good ecological status/potential. This threshold may be sufficient to propose it as a good/moderate cyanobacterial bloom intensity threshold. The average values of 3.3, 9.9 and 22.4 mg l(-1) were recorded in the lakes with a moderate, poor and bad ecological status/potential, respectively. The WHO-defined moderate risk threshold of 10 mg l(-1) was exceeded only in lakes with a poor or bad ecological status/potential. The structure of cyanobacteria assemblages changed along with the deterioration of the ecological status/potential and a decrease in Chroococcales biomass and an increase in Oscillatoriales and Nostocales biomass. Nevertheless, Planktolyngbya limnetica, Pseudanabaena limnetica and Aphanizomenon gracile had a significant presence in the total cyanobacterial biomass in all surveyed lakes.

J	Anthony, KMW; Anthony, P				Anthony, Katey M. Walter; Anthony, Peter			Constraining spatial variability of methane ebullition seeps in thermokarst lakes using point process models	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Ebullition is an important but highly heterogeneous mode of methane emission in lakes. Variability in both spatial distribution and temporal flux creates difficulty in constraining uncertainties in whole lake emission estimates. Analysis of short- and long-term flux measurements on 162 ebullition seeps in 24 panarctic lakes confirmed that seep classes, identified a priori according to bubble patterns in winter lake ice, have distinct associated fluxes irrespective of lake or region. To understand the drivers of ebullition's spatial variability and uncover ways to better quantify ebullition in field work, we combined point-process modeling with field measurements of 2679 GPS-marked and classified ebullition seeps in three Alaskan thermokarst (thaw) lakes that varied by region, permafrost type, and seep distribution. Spatial analysis of field data revealed that seeps cluster above thawed permafrost soil mounds in lake bottoms. Seep density and clustering, determined from field observations, were used as parameters in a Poisson cluster process model to simulate seeps across entire lake surfaces. Sampling results indicated that (1) applying seep-class mean flux values to unmeasured seeps counted on ice-bubble surveys does not compromise accuracy of whole lake flux estimates; (2) three distributed 50 m(2) ice-bubble survey transects more accurately estimate mean lake ebullition than 17 dispersed 0.2 m(2) bubble traps; and (3) the uncertainty associated with whole lake mean ebullition estimated by lake-ice survey transects is inversely related to seep density. Findings suggest that transect field data collected on a large number of widely distributed lakes can be combined to provide a well-constrained, bottom-up estimate of regional lake ebullition.

J	VERTA, M				VERTA, M			CHANGES IN FISH MERCURY CONCENTRATIONS IN AN INTENSIVELY FISHED LAKE	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												A small polyhumic lake inhabited by northern pike (Esox lucius), burbot (Lota lota), perch (Perca fluviatilis), roach (Rutilus rutilus), and eel (Anguilla anguilla) was fished intensively during Spring 1984 and 1985 to lower the high mercury levels in the top predator, northern pike. A total catch of 29.5 kg.cntdot.ha-1 (74% roach) was removed which represented about 50% of the total fish biomass. Mercury concentrations in burbot, large pike, and small roach had decreased by 1987 and 1988, but increased in young pike and some perch. Northern pike had the clearest increase in growth rate, while that of perch and roach levelled off within 3 yr at the prefishing level. Only a small increase in growth rate of burbot occurred. The yearly accumulation of mercury in northern pike remained constant, and the decrease in [Hg] was apparently due to growth dilution. The decrease in [Hg] of burbot and roach is explained by a switch to a diet with lower [Hg] or a decrease in water methylmercury concentrations. The amount of methylmercury removed from the lake by fishing was equivalent to several years of calculated mercury methylation and accumulation in the fish. Overfishing may be a feasible means of lowering methylmercury levels in this type of oligotrophic lake.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				OCT	1990	47	10					1888	1897		10.1139/f90-213	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f90-213													WOS:A1990EC80300004

This is a crucial area where the long-wavelength topography can be used to identify motions of the ductile flow beneath the eastern Tibetan Plateau to the Yangtze platform. The results indicate that there are two high conductors (1-10 omega m) beneath the LXF zone. One of the conductors is at a depth of approximately 15-35 km with a length of 40 km in the southwest profile, whereas the other is at a depth of approximately 10-20 km with a length of 20 km in the northeast profile. These results indicate that the conductors along the LXF zone become shallower and smaller from the SW to NE. Based on the framework of the material escape to the east of the Tibetan Plateau and the strike-slip polarity of the active faults, we propose a new geodynamic model for the study area. The high conductors probably originated northwest of the Lijiang area. After crossing the LXF, part of the mid-crustal ductile material moved to the NE between the LXF and Ninglang fault. Therefore, the LXF presents significant left-lateral strike-slip deformation, and the Ninglang fault presents right-lateral strike-slip deformation. In addition, with the thermal springs exposed in the subsurface of the Lugu Lake region, we suggest that a potential geothermal field could be developed underneath the LXF and NW sides of the Lugu Lake region.

HIGH PREVALENCE OF BUCCAL ULCERATIONS IN LARGEMOUTH BASS, MICROPTERUS SALMOIDES (CENTRARCHIDAE) FROM MICHIGAN INLAND LAKES ASSOCIATED WITH MYZOBDELLA LUGUBRIS LEIDY 1851 (ANNELIDA: HIRUDINEA)	PARASITE												Widespread mouth ulcerations were observed in largemouth bass collected from eight inland lakes in the Lower Peninsula of Michigan during the summer months of 2002 and 2003. These ulcerations were associated with, and most likely caused by, leech parasitism. Through the use of morphological dichotomous keys, it was determined that all leeches collected are of one species: Myzobdella lugubris. Among the eight lakes examined, Lake Orion and Devils Lake had the highest prevalence of leech parasitism (34 % and 29 %, respectively) and mouth ulcerations (53 % and 68 %, respectively). Statistical analyses demonstrated that leech and ulcer prevalence varied significantly from one lake to the other. Additionally, it was determined that the relationship between the prevalence of ulcers and the prevalence of leech attachment is significant, indicating that leech parasitism is most likely the cause of ulceration. The ulcers exhibited deep hemorrhagic centers and raised irregular edges. Affected areas lost their epithelial lining and submucosa, with masses of bacteria colonizing the damaged tissues. Since largemouth bass is a popular global sportfish and critical to the food web of inland lakes, there are concerns that the presence of leeches, damaged buccal mucosa, and general unsightliness may negatively affect this important sportfishery.					faisal, M/GQB-4757-2022; Eissa, Alaa Eldin/F-5860-2015	Eissa, Alaa Eldin/0000-0002-7042-8999													1252-607X	1776-1042				FEB	2011	18	1					79	84		10.1051/parasite/2011181079	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/parasite/2011181079								21395209					WOS:000289396100010
J	de Oliveira, MD; Calheiros, DF				de Oliveira, MD; Calheiros, DF			Flood pulse influence on phytoplankton communities of the south Pantanal floodplain, Brazil	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Four sites situated on the Pantanal floodplain (Paraguay River and floodplain) were sampled throughout the annual cycle, mainly during the rising water period, with the aim of evaluating the effects of the flood pulse on the composition and population densities of the phytoplanktonic communities. Comprehensive water chemistry data were collected. Eighty-two taxa were found, numerically dominated by Chlorophyceae (23 taxa). Cryptophyceae (principally Cryptomonas brasiliensis) occurred in all samples, and were responsible for 47-58% of the phytoplankton abundance in the studied area. Highest phytoplanktonic population density was at the rising water period, when the limnological changes are most marked as the river water first enters into contact with the floodplain. During this period, when intense decomposition occurs, the Cryptophyceae decreased and the Euglenophyceae increased, except at site 1 (Castelo Lake), where this group were more stable during the year, representing 35-56% of the phytoplankton. In the falling water period (September and October), the phytoplankton was also represented by Bacillariophyceae and Cyanophyceae. In the Pantanal, the great abundance and sometimes dominance of Cryptophyceae, may be due largely to adverse conditions for the development of other groups; the former are adapted to low availability of dissolved nutrients, and high water transparency, such conditions prevailing during the high water period.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				JUN 1	2000	427	1-3					101	112																WOS:000088580100009

Despite being a critical issue, the extent of contamination in tropical fish from developing countries like Bangladesh remains somewhat unexplored. In this study, ten economically vital fish species (Osteogeneiosus militaris, Arius gagora, Harpadon nehereus, Mugil ephalus, Pseudapocryptes elongates, Apocryptes bato, Labeo bata, Tenualosa toil, Notopterus notopterus, and Pampus chinensis) from the Pasur River, Bangladesh, were analyzed by atomic absorption spectrometer for the concentrations of four concerned heavy metals, viz., As, Cr, Cd, and Pb, and the associated human health risks. The mean concentrations (mg/kg) followed the order of As (3.30 +/- 1.43) > Pb (2.32 +/- 0.73) > Cr (0.63 +/- 0.29) > Cd (0.37 +/- 0.24). Additionally, the bioaccumulation factor of the metals in the investigated fish species followed a decreasing trend of As (824.75) > Cr (781.25) > Cd (744) > Pb (385.83). While most species fell below the minimum bioaccumulation line, a few exceptions were noted for some species specific to metals. Health risk assessments indicated no significant carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic risks for both children and adults, although children exhibited greater vulnerability to both types of health effects. Multivariate analysis and local perceptions supported the conclusion that heavy metals primarily originated from anthropogenic sources related to development activities adjacent to the riverine areas.

Chronological framework for the lateglacial pollen and macrofossil sequence in the Pirin Mountains, Bulgaria: Lake Besbog and Lake Kremensko-5	HOLOCENE												The sediments of numerous cirque lakes in the Pirin Mountains have yielded several generalized pollen diagrams, but low stratigraphic and temporal resolution has hampered detailed reconstruction of the vegetational history, especially for the Lateglacial. New pollen and macrofossil analyses of high stratigraphic resolution combined with well-controlled time-depth curves for Lake Besbog and Lake Kremensko-5 now permit the firm identification of the Lateglacial interstadial interval (Bolling-Allerod), dated at 13.8-12.6 ka cal. BP at Besbog and 14.1-12.8 ka cal. BP at Kremensko-5 and correlated with the Greenland Interstadial GI-l (14.5-12.6 ka cal. BP). Macrofossil analyses indicate that during the Bolling-Allerod period Betula and Juniperus occurred around the lakes (at 2124-2250 in a.s.l). Following the Younger Dryas a Betula woodland covered the mountains between 1900 and 2250 in in the early Holocene. Because of higher summer insolation at this time, the temperate deciduous forest reached up to 1900 in, or 800 in above their present limit, producing a regional pollen rain that dominated pollen deposition in the cirque lakes. After about 7000 cal. yr BP conifer forests replaced the birch woodland at middle and high elevations.

The respiration patterns were modeled using piecewise linear regression with break-point and simple hyperbolic functions. The mathematical constants obtained from the controlled laboratory experiments were good ecophysiological indicators of species-specific "oxy-regulatory capacity." The oxy-regulatory capacity of different chironomid communities was calculated for subfossil assemblages collected from 52 lakes in West Greenland. The overall assemblage structure was expressed using detrended correspondence analysis (DCA). The oxy-regulatory capacity was as strongly correlated to DCA axis 1 (r = 0.72-0.86, p < 0.001), as were surface water temperature (r = 0.82, p < 0.001) and nutrients (r = 0.47-0.86, p < 0.001). Warm-water chironomid assemblages characterized by taxa such as Chironomus, Dicrotendipes, Ablabesmyia, and Procladius had a high oxy-regulatory capacity. Cold-water assemblages were dominated by oxy-conformers such as Heterotrissocladius, Micropsectra, Hydrobaenus, and Diamesa. An expression of the oxy-regulatory capacity of a given chironomid assemblage can be directly inferred from a simple model using weighted averaging of the ecophysiological mathematical constants. The autecological information from controlled experiments provides important additional information for interpretations in chironomid paleolimnology. The results can also be used to identify secondary changes or mismatches in multiproxy down-core paleoclimate studies.

In this study, multiple methods-seepage meters, piezometers, and the type-curve fitting method using temperature profile data-were employed to estimate fluxes at the groundwater-surface water interface of a small pond (Osong Pond) in South Korea. Measurements were conducted and compared during the wet season of 2020 (July-August 2020). Additionally, temperature data were collected during the dry seasons of 2021 and 2022 (November 2021-March 2022) to assess the applicability of the type-curve fitting method for long-term monitoring. The average vertical velocity measured by seepage meters was the highest (2.67 x 10(-)(8) m/s), while the type-curve fitting method estimated the lowest average velocity (2.58 x 10(-)(10) m/s). During the dry seasons of 2021-2022, the type-curve fitting method yielded an average flow velocity of 7.11 x 10(-)(10) m/s, comparable to the dry season values of 2020. Although the lakebed temperature-based method underestimated vertical velocities in this study area, it can be effective for long-term monitoring. We recommend combining multiple measurement techniques tailored to the geological characteristics (e.g., topography and sediment composition) and climatic conditions of study sites. This integrated approach facilitates a more accurate evaluation of groundwater-surface water interactions and enhances understanding of the broader flow system.

Phytoplankton were the major biomass producers when algae were actively growing, and the algal fraction (> 3.0 .mu.m) contributed on average 75.sbd.80% to the total biomass of microplankton. When the phytoplankton bloom began to decline bacterial biomass increased rapidly and, at the end of the bloom, bacteria contributed 48.7.sbd.69.98% to the total biomass of microplankton. The high bacterial abundance during phytoplankton bloom breakdown followed the highest rates of glucose uptake, and the highest rates of alkaline phosphatase, leucine-aminopeptidase, .beta.-galactosidase and .beta.-glucosidase activities. The majority of enzyme activity was associated with the bacterial size fraction of seston. The activities of free (dissolved in water) exoenzymes were negligible. The synthesis of bacterial exoenzymes was under control of an induction/derepression mechanism, and depended on the amount of easily assimilable substrates, and/or the presence of polymeric organic compounds in the water, which served as substrates for exoenzymatic hydrolysis. The tight metabolic coupling between bacterial exoenzymatic hydrolysis and uptake of low molecular weight substrates, and its ecological significance is discussed.

Natural dams (glaciers, moraines) that maintained a high water level in glacial palaeolakes were melted or cut by erosion during Late Pleistocene climate amelioration. With the retreat of the glaciers from the Andean valleys during prominent regional deglaciation, outflow from the eastern side of Andes to the Pacific Ocean was formed about 13.2 ka BP. As a result, the water level in glacial palaeolakes fell rapidly in stages. These changes were often preceded by volcanic-tectonic activity, which is suggested to be the "touch of butterfly" releasing mass balance adjustment in the changing landscape. The lacustrine tephra stratigraphic pattern from the Andes, comprising more than 50 horizons since the last glaciation, is presented. The correlation of palaeoenvironmental changes between the Andes and the Patagonian Steppe is suggested on the basis of two dacite marker horizons. The deglaciation event that led to development of the new hydrological system in the Andean palaeolakeland formed several large but short-lived palaeolakes in closed basins in the Patagonian Steppe probably due to melting of local ice and permafrost accumulated during glaciation on the surrounding mountains and elevated plains.

In Kejimkujik National Park and National Historic Site, Nova Scotia, Canada, high concentrations of total mercury (THg) were found in tissues of yellow perch (Perca flavescens). The aim of this study was to evaluate a possible relationship between THg concentrations and the morphology of perch liver as a main site of metal storage and toxicity. Yellow perch were sampled from five lakes known to contain fish representing a wide range in Hg concentrations in fall 2013. The ultrastructure of hepatocytes and the distribution of Hg within the liver parenchyma were analyzed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and electron energy loss spectrometry (EELS). The relative area of macrophage aggregates (MAs) in the liver was determined using image analysis software and fluorescence microscopy. No relation between general health indicators (Fulton's condition index) and THg was observed. In line with this, TEM examination of the liver ultrastructure revealed no prominent pathologies related to THg accumulation. However, a morphological parameter that appeared to increase with muscle THg was the relative area of MAs in the liver. The hepatic lysosomes appeared to be enlarged in samples with the highest THg concentrations. Interestingly, EELS analysis revealed that the MAs and hepatic lysosomes contained Hg.

Roughness and storage capacity of freshwater ice in the Straits of Mackinac	COLD REGIONS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												In the event of a maritime oil spill in winter conditions, the fate of oil released under ice presents considerable difficulties with respect to detection, containment and recovery compared to spills that form slicks in open water. This study presents the first quantification of roughness and associated storage capacity of the ice-water interface for freshwater ice in the Laurentian Great Lakes in North America. Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) observations are used to retrieve ice thicknesses every 2.5 cm on a grid over ice ranging between 0.26 and 0.48 m in the Straits of Mackinac to derive a digital elevation model of the ice bottom. The root mean square of height deviations of the ice underside is observed to be 0.03 m (over a correlation length of approximately 20 m) with a storage capacity of 0.03 m3/m2. The observed physical characteristics relevant to oil entrainment at the ice underside are similar to those reported for first year sea ice and may store similar quantities of oil during the initial spill. However, the difference in the physical structure between first year ice (with brine channels) and freshwater ice (consolidated ice cap) may result in a disparity in the timing of oil appearance, and require considerably different remediation treatment.

Maternal investment and delayed feeding in neonatal Lake Erie watersnakes: a life-history strategy	JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												Neonatal growth can have lasting consequences on survival and reproduction. In many taxa, larger, faster growing neonates experience higher survival, reach sexual maturity more rapidly, and achieve higher lifetime fecundity. In contrast to their closest relatives, Lake Erie watersnakes grow slower, mature later, and may delay feeding until after their first hibernation. To determine if Lake Erie watersnakes do indeed delay feeding until after their first hibernation, we compared age class 0 (between birth and first hibernation) and age class 1 (emergence from hibernation and through the first full season) snakes in the field and in the laboratory. In the field, only 0.6% of pre-hibernation neonates were found to contain prey, while 11.9% of post-hibernation neonates contained prey. During captive feeding experiments, the probability of eating was positively correlated with age (binary logistic regression, Wald mml:msubsup12/mml:msubsup=25.354, P0.001). To clarify the underlying mechanism for delayed feeding, we compared neonatal yolk and fat reserves among species with delayed feeding (Lake Erie watersnakes, Graham's crayfish-eating snakes), species that commence feeding immediately after birth (common gartersnakes, Dekay's brown snakes) and a species falling between these extremes (queen snakes). Like Lake Erie watersnakes, Graham's crayfish-eating snakes contained large energy reserves (yolk+fat body mass to carcass mass ratio=0.39 and 0.24, respectively), common gartersnakes and Dekay's brown snakes lacked measurable reserves (0.00), and queen snakes contained intermediate reserves (0.17). Taken together, this evidence suggests that neonatal Lake Erie watersnakes do delay feeding until after their first hibernation and contain large energy reserves at birth to facilitate this behavior. While most snake life-history studies have focused on the trade-off between offspring size and number, Lake Erie watersnake females invest large amounts of energy in offspring condition.																			0952-8369	1469-7998				FEB	2017	301	2					150	156		10.1111/jzo.12404	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jzo.12404													WOS:000395000400008

Contribution of sediment fluxes and transformations to the summer nitrogen budget of an Upper Mississippi River backwater system	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Routing nitrate through backwaters of regulated floodplain rivers to increase retention could decrease loading to nitrogen (N)-sensitive coastal regions. Sediment core determinations of N flux were combined with inflow-outflow fluxes to develop mass balance approximations of N uptake and transformations in a flow-controlled backwater of the Upper Mississippi River (USA). Inflow was the dominant nitrate source (>95%) versus nitrification and varied as a function of source water concentration since flow was constant. Nitrate uptake length increased linearly, while uptake velocity decreased linearly, with increasing inflow concentration to 2 mg l(-1), indicating limitation of N uptake by loading. N saturation at higher inflow concentration coincided with maximum uptake capacity, 40% uptake efficiency, and an uptake length 2 times greater than the length of the backwater. Nitrate diffusion and denitrification in sediment accounted for 27% of the backwater nitrate retention, indicating that assimilation by other biota or denitrification on other substrates were the dominant uptake mechanisms. Ammonium export from the backwater was driven by diffusive efflux from the sediment. Ammonium increased from near zero at the inflow to a maximum mid-lake, then declined slightly toward the outflow due to uptake during transport. Ammonium export was small compared to nitrate retention.																			0018-8158					FEB	2008	598						95	107		10.1007/s10750-007-9142-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-007-9142-x													WOS:000251874300008
J	Frei, A; Lee, S				Frei, Allan; Lee, ShihYan			A comparison of optical-band based snow extent products during spring over North America	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												We compare the performances of two widely used hemispheric scale snow products during April. May, and June over North America. The Interactive Multisensor Snow and Ice Mapping System (IMS), based primarily on optical-band remotely sensed images, is the latest incarnation of a product that dates back to the 1960s and has been used as input to operational weather forecasting models as well as for establishing the historical climatology of snow extent over land surfaces. NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) has been used for numerous applications since It was launched aboard the Terra satellite platform in 1999 The MODIS snow product is based primarily on optical-band reflectances. We include in our analysis only observations that are largely unobstructed by clouds as determined using the MODIS cloud detection algorithm Then, after removing the influences of terrain and projection errors, we identify regions and land surface types where discrepancies between these two products occur. We also compare IMS and MODIS to the snow reanalysis produced by the Canadian Meteorological Center (CMC). We find that on seasonal time scales, the most pronounced differences between the IMS and MODIS snow products occurs during the ablation season over North America. Our results corroborate earlier studies showing pronounced differences over the northern tundra in June, where MODIS appears to be in agreement with other observations, as well as differences in April and May in the boreal forest, where evidence suggests that both products may be biased (although MODIS biases may be smaller) in comparison with the CMC product (which is based on station observations) The influence of clouds may be a factor even though the analysis includes only clear days. Another possible explanation for these discrepancies Involves the impact of numerous small lakes over the North American landscape on the interpretation of satellite retrievals in the visible band, although there are other potential sources of error in both products For example, comparison to the CMC reanalysis suggests that MODIS may be overestimating snow during the ablation season in the boreal forest The resolution of these discrepancies may affect our understanding of the seasonal snow cover cycle, the evaluation of and development of parameterization schemes for climate models, and the development of a climate data record for snow cover.

Recent high-resolution sediment research (e.g. varved sediments) has revealed optically invisible tephra fingerprints and provided high-precision tephra ages. However, a tephra-based correlation cannot succeed without detailed knowledge of the tephra characteristics in a proximal area to correlate with tephra in high-resolution sediments in remote areas. Here we documented the detailed characteristics of Towada-Chuseri (To-Cu) tephra, which is associated with the Middle Holocene volcanic explosivity index 5 eruption of Towada volcano, northeast Japan. We used To-Cu tephra samples to achieve the proximal-distal correlation of three members: Chuseri pumice (Cu), Kanegasawa pumice (Kn) and Utarube ash (Ut). These distal occurrences correlate with proximal To-Cu tephra based on volcanic glass morphology and refractive index, as well as on major element composition of volcanic glass shards. Refractive indices allow the preliminary correlation of each member, and major element composition helps in distinguishing Ut from the other members. Glass morphology provides additional support. These correlations reveal that To-Cu, especially Cu, covered central to northeast Japan while confirming that To-Cu is the representative tephra in the Middle Holocene of the Tohoku region.					; Ishimura, Daisuke/NOF-7945-2025	Ishimura, Daisuke/0000-0002-4798-3425; 													0267-8179	1099-1417				JAN	2020	35	1-2			SI		334	348		10.1002/jqs.3161	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jqs.3161		NOV 2019											WOS:000495607200001

CO2] and NH3-N below the thermocline of lake 227 [Canada] can be reproduced using a simple numerical model. The model uses a constant vertical eddy diffusion coefficient and assumes the sediments to be the sole source of the chemical species. Analogs dependent on O2 concentration can effectively represent conditions at the interface of the modeled region and the shallower depths in the lake. The best fit value for the vertical eddy diffusion coefficient is 3.1 .times. 10-3 cm2.cntdot.s-1. This is in good agreement with other independent measurements of this phenomena. The best fit fluxes of CH4, dissolved inorganic C and NH3-N are calculated. The flux of CH4 is similar to that found in other small productive northern lakes and the ratio of CH4: .SIGMA. CO2 production of 1.73 falls in the range of values established for fermentation of mixed organic materials and sediments. The flux of .SIGMA. CO2 is 50-75% of the bicarbonate flux (10-15 .times. 10-3 mol.cntdot.m-2.cntdot.day-1) found previously in Linsley Pond, Connecticut.																			0706-652X	1205-7533					1980	37	3					552	558		10.1139/f80-070	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f80-070													WOS:A1980JJ97200027

Asexual reproduction occurs by formation of quadriflagellate zoospores which disrupt the integrity of the cells upon release causing the filament to disintegrate. Study of the effects of 100 different combinations of irradiance, temperature and photoperiod revealed that zoospore formation is favored by high temperatures near 20.degree. C, high light levels of 520 .mu.E .cntdot. m-2 .cntdot. s-1 and photoperiods of either short day (8:16 h light-dark) or long day cycles (16:8 h light-dark). Zoospore formation is minimal under conditions of low temperature (5.degree. C), low irradiance (32.5 .mu.E .cntdot. m-2 .cntdot. s-1) and neutral day lengths (12:12 h light-dark). These observations explain the decline in U. zonata biomass when water temperatures rise above 10.degree. C. The combined effect of rising water temperatures and increasing day lengths causes progressively more filaments to switch from vegetative growth to zoospore production resulting in an increasing loss of biomass.																				1529-8817					1985	21	2					235	239																WOS:A1985AKJ2900010

Permafrost conditions vary greatly, and the recent changes on the QTP are not well known in the hinterland. Here, we examine the changes in climate and permafrost temperatures in several different regions. Climate data were obtained from three weather stations from 1957 to 2019. Annual mean air temperature (T-a) has gradually increased at .031 degrees C/yr-.039 degrees C/yr. Climate warming has been more rapid in the past two decades, particularly during the cold season (November to February). Precipitation has also been slowly increasing during the instrumental record. However, there is pronounced heterogeneity in the seasonal distribution of precipitation, with very little falling between October and April. Ground temperatures and active-layer thickness (ALT) have been investigated over similar to 20 years at five sites representative of the hinterland of the QTP. These sites are located along the Qinghai-Tibet Highway, which crosses the permafrost zone and traverses the mountainous area and basin areas. Annual mean ground temperatures within the active layer (T-al similar to 1 m depth) indicate recent ground warming at all sites, at rates near .05 degrees C/yr. The ALT at five sites has been increasing steadily by 2-9 cm/yr, with an average of 4.6 cm/yr. The temperature near the permafrost table (T-ps) has been increasing at .01 degrees C/yr and .06 degrees C/yr, with an average of .03 degrees C/yr. Permafrost temperatures at 15 m depth (T-g) have been increasing by about .01 degrees C/yr-.02 degrees C/yr. The southern boundary (AD site) of the permafrost has warmed the least among the five locations. In high mountainous areas where permafrost temperatures are low (e.g., KLS site), the annual mean T-g has increased by nearly .02 degrees C/yr. The rate of permafrost warming at a basin site (BLH), with relatively high ground temperatures, was approximately .01 degrees C/yr. The GIPL2.0 model simulation results indicate that the annual mean permafrost temperature at 1 m depth at these sites will increase by .6 degrees C-1.8 degrees C in the next 100 years (to 2100) and that ALT will increase by similar to 40-100 cm. We also discuss the impacts of permafrost changes on the environment and infrastructure on the QTP. This study provides useful information to understand observed and anticipated permafrost changes in this region, under different shared socioeconomic pathways, which will allow engineers to develop adaptation measures.																				2296-665X				FEB 21	2022	10								836085	10.3389/fenvs.2022.836085	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2022.836085													WOS:000769766700001

Variability in the ice sheet elevations over Antarctica derived from repetitive SARAL/AltiKa radar altimeter data (2013-2016)	JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE												Changes in surface elevations of polar ice sheets are the result of changes in ice dynamics and surface mass balance. Here, we present intra- and inter-annual elevation changes over the Antarctic ice sheet using the AltiKa radar altimeter's 40 Hz geophysical data record products for the period 2013-2016. Slope corrections were applied on the elevations using a digital elevation model (DEM) available from NASA's ice, cloud and land elevation satellite (ICESat). Comparison of elevations from AltiKa and ICESat's DEM yielded correlation, bias and root-mean-square-deviation values of the order of 0.99, -2.88 and 23.04 m, respectively, indicating the first-level accuracy of a former dataset. Further comparison of Airborne Topographic Mapper dataset with AltiKa derived elevation yielded 0.4 m root-mean-square-deviation over a part of Vostok subglacial lake. The intra-annual change indicates that for GY2 (glaciological year), GY3 and GY4, number of negative elevation change points exceeded the number of positive elevation change points during the Antarctic austral summer period (December-February). Inter-annual elevation changes were negative during 2013-2014 and positive during 2014-2015 over east Antarctica, whereas in west Antarctica negative elevation changes were observed for both periods.																			2347-4327	0973-774X				APR	2019	128	3							64	10.1007/s12040-019-1093-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12040-019-1093-x													WOS:000460945500004
J	MARSHALL, BE				MARSHALL, BE			A PRELIMINARY ASSESSMENT OF THE BIOMASS OF THE PELAGIC SARDINE LIMNOTHRISSA-MIODON IN LAKE KARIBA	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												The sardine Limnothrissa miodon was very patchily distributed in Lake Kariba in 1981-1983 and its mean biomass was 59.23 kg ha-1, declining from 90.91 kg ha-1 in 1981 to 38.66 kg ha-1 in 1983. In addition, the mean size of the fish fell from 55.2 mm in 1981 to 49.9 mm in 1983. These changes are attributed to the effects of drought and reduced river flows as well as to the high level of commercial fishing for this species. There was a correlation between commercial catches and biomass estimates which allowed estimation of biomass in previous years from fishing statistics. Fishing effort appeared to be a major influence on sardine abundance: total biomass in 1985 was about 10% of what it was in 1974 when the fishery began. When expressed in terms of unit area, as is usual for African lakes, the pelagic biomass appeared to be greater in Lake Tanganyika, where Limmothrissa is endemic, than in Lake Kariba, although there is little difference in their primary productivity, but consideration in terms of volume rather than area shows that this was not the case.																				1095-8649				APR	1988	32	4					515	524		10.1111/j.1095-8649.1988.tb05391.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8649.1988.tb05391.x													WOS:A1988N137400003
J	Warren, CR; Kirkbride, MP				Warren, CR; Kirkbride, MP			Temperature and bathymetry of ice-contact lakes in Mount Cook National Park, New Zealand	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF GEOLOGY AND GEOPHYSICS												Several ice-contact lakes have formed in conjunction with twentieth century glacier retreat in Mt Cook National Park. They occupy overdeepened glacial valleys and are damned by terminal moraines and/or outwash heads. During the autumns of 1994 and 1995, the temperature and bathymetry of "Maud lake", "Godley lake", and Hooker Lake were surveyed. The near-glacier vertical water temperature profiles exhibited greater temperature variation than those at the distal ends of the lakes. Thermal stratification existed in Hooker Lake, whereas both Maud and Godley lakes were thoroughly mixed. Water temperatures in the latter were consistently between 3 and 4.5 degrees C, but most parts of Hooker Lake were cooler than 2 degrees C, with a minimum recorded temperature of 0.2 degrees C. These contrasts are important because melting of submerged parts of glacier termini is significant for ablation rates and for the dynamics of calving termini. All the lakes are steep sided and deep. Maud and Godley lakes approach 100 m in depth, whereas Booker Lake has a maximum recorded depth of 136 m. Extensive flat floors in Maud and Godley lakes probably reflect rapid sediment accumulation following glacier retreat. Water depth at the termini of iceberg-calving glaciers is known to correlate strongly with rates of iceberg production and hence the rate of glacier retreat. However, given the substantial water depths through which these glaciers (and also the neighbouring Tasman Glacier) have retreated, they appear to be more stable than comparable glaciers in other countries. The subaqueous geometry of all the glacier termini comprises a projecting ramp of glacier ice. All the lakes are being enlarged by glacier retreat except Maud lake, which has been reduced in size since 1995 by the advance of Maud and Grey Glaciers.

Despite some gaps in the records, phytoliths, diatoms, delta O-18(diatom), pollen, coprophilous fungus spores, microscopic charred particles (micro-charcoal), and burnt-grass phytoliths, indicate vegetation disturbances caused by climatic changes, anthropogenic influences, fire, and herbivore activity. Pollen spectra indicates a moist period (3600-2600 cal yr BP), which co-occurs with an increase in fires, possibly due to greater biomass fuel loads coupled with the moderate presence of large herbivores. Subsequently, a dry period (2600-1900 cal yr BP) saw a rapid increase of large herbivores probably congregating around the lake, a contention supported also by the occurrence of nutrient-rich waters. This dry period saw reduced fires and a decline of C-3 grasses in favor of C-4 grasses. The arrival of herders in the Cape after 2000 cal yr BP is not immediately apparent in the multiple records, except for minor vegetation changes and regional fires c. 1200-1400 cal yr BP. However, a more consistent presence of livestock in the immediate area of Princessvlei occurs only after c. 600 cal yr BP, when peak frequencies of coprophilous spores coincide with changes in vegetation composition and occurrence of more eutrophic waters in the lake. The introduction of exotic flora, fire suppression, and a reduction of herding activities, characterizes the period of European settlement (c. 300 BP to present). (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Environmental changes of the last 1000 years on Prince of Wales Island, Nunavut, Canada	ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												A pollen record from a lake sediment core from southeastern Prince of Wales Island, Nunavut, Canada (SW08; 72.3177, -97.2678, 104 m a.s.l) provides the first high-resolution July temperature reconstruction for the last 1,000 years for the central Canadian Arctic Archipelago. The vegetation underwent marked transitions during the Little Ice Age (LIA; 1500-1800 CE) and Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA; 1090-1250 CE), which was primarily observed in the proportion of Cyperaceae, Poaceae, and Salix pollen. Cyperaceae pollen was highest in the samples corresponding to the MCA, whereas Poaceae increased during the LIA. In the last 30 years, Salix and Betula pollen increased. The mean July temperature reconstruction showed a long-term cooling from 1080-1915 CE with a sustained cold period from 1800-1915 CE prior to twentieth-century warming. A synthesis of paleoclimate records from across the Arctic demonstrates that pollen-based reconstructions record both high and low frequency climate variability, when sampling resolution is sufficient, and can improve regional climate reconstructions.

We studied this idea with four unionid mussel species Anodonta sp. (A. anatina), Pseudanodonta complanata, Unio pictorum and U. tumidus in four Finnish lakes. delta N-15 and delta C-13 signatures of mussels were compared with surface sediment and summer averages of their potential food sources and planktonic herbivores. Isotope compositions of Anodonta, Pseudanodonta and Unio differed significantly between lakes but were roughly similar within lakes, except in the smallest study lake. There was considerable deviation in the delta C-13 of mussels relative to that of particulate organic matter (POM) in water or sediment, suggesting selective use of food sources. The delta C-13 of POM also showed considerable temporal variation. Enrichment in delta N-15 mussels over that of POM was less than expected, but the mussel signatures matched closely with those of herbivorous Daphnia. We suggest that unionid mussels can provide a reasonable baseline estimate for pelagic food web comparisons with much less sampling effort than other suggested primary consumers.

The paleohydrology was reconstructed from the relative abundance of thaumarchaeol (%thaum) and the archaeol and caldarchaeol ecometric (ACE) index. The %thaum-inferred lake-level record was extended to deglaciation, showing three periods (11.9-13.0, 14.1-14.7 and 15.1-17.2 cal ka BP) with relatively higher lake levels than those during the early Holocene. The ACE record demonstrates three periods (10.6-112, 132-13.4 and 17.4-17.6 cal ka BP) of elevated salinity when the lake was shallow. Filtered TEX86 record based on archaeal lipid distributions corresponded to relatively higher lake levels, implying that a certain lake size is required for using the TEX86 paleothermometer. At 1-4 cal ka BP, the reconstructed temperature fluctuated significantly and correlated negatively with inferred lake level, indicating that lake temperature and hydrological change might be coupled during this period. We attribute this co-variance to the importance of summer temperature in controlling evaporation for this arid/semi-arid region. Moreover, our results indicate that archaeal lipids have potential in reconstructing paleoclimate patterns from lacustrine sedimentary cores, but the data should be interpreted with care.

Namely, the lowest delta(18)O(DO) values, obtained at 10:00 and 14:00 (16.0 and 15.5 parts per thousand, respectively), correspond to the highest amount of cyanobacterial cells observed (66 and 63 mg dm(-3), respectively), whereas the minimum delta(13)C(DIC) (-10.6 parts per thousand) obtained at 22:00 corresponds to the maximum content of organic matter (110 mg dm(-3)). This evidence suggests that isotopic assays of delta(18)O(DO) and delta(13)C(DIC) are a reliable tool for the quantitative study of biochemical processes in freshwater systems.

J	Lee, HW; Kim, EJ; Park, SS; Choi, JH				Lee, Hye Won; Kim, Eun Jung; Park, Seok Soon; Choi, Jung Hyun			Effects of Climate Change on the Movement of Turbidity Flow in a Stratified Reservoir	WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT												In this study, we investigated the effects of climate change on the movement of the turbidity flow in a stratified reservoir. Reservoir turbidity is primarily caused by the concentration of suspended solids in a watershed. Under the effects of climate change, which increases the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events in the Asian monsoon area, turbidity can be considered to be an essential water quality variable in a reservoir that supplies drinking water. We adopted a two-dimensional hydrodynamic water quality model coupled to a watershed model and used a future climate scenario applied to the Yongdam Reservoir in South Korea. To account for the uncertainty of climate change scenarios and the extent of the variation of both temperature and precipitation, three cases each from the 2050's and 2090's were selected for simulation. The simulations predicted that the significance of the summer stratification would produce a vertical circulation lower than 8 m in the warming reservoir of the 2090 scenario in comparison to 15 m in the 2050 scenario. The limited vertical circulation caused the density plume to spread within a depth of 8 m of the reservoir, isolating the upper water with high suspended solid concentrations from the hypolimnetic water. The results of this study provide the optimum horizontal and vertical location of the intake aqueducts to obtain drinking water with low turbidity during extremely heavy rainfall.																			0920-4741	1573-1650				SEP	2015	29	11					4095	4110		10.1007/s11269-015-1047-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-015-1047-2													WOS:000358589200014
J	WATRAS, CJ; BAKER, AL				WATRAS, CJ; BAKER, AL			THE SPECTRAL DISTRIBUTION OF DOWNWELLING LIGHT IN NORTHERN WISCONSIN LAKES	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												The special characteristics of downwelling light were determined for seven lakes in the Trout Lake region of Wisconsin (46 .degree.N, 89.degree.W) during late summer. Most of the lakes were subjects of early studies in limnological optics during the era of Birge and Juday. They are mesotrophic to oligotrophic systems that vary in organic color from 0 to > 260 PCU. Scans were made with an underwater spectroradiometer at 1M to 5M depth intervals to measure the wavelength-specific quantum flux between 350 nM and 850nM. The readings were integrated over 2 nm steps in this wavelength range. The results clearly show how the spectral distribution of light in a given lake is progressively compressed into a relatively narrow region with depth. Increasing concentrations of dissolved and/or colloidal humic material between lakes is accompanied by a shift in this spectral region from green to red light; and the ratio rc = (quantum flux490 to 620nM)/(quantum flux620 to 750nM), effectively separates lakes on the basis of organic staining. Although the selectively attenuating effects of phytoplankton were secondary to the gelbstoff effect, absorption by two photosynthetic pigments, chlorophyll-a and phycocyanin, was indicated beneath thin plankton layers in some lakes with red light at depth.																			0003-9136					JUN	1988	112	4					481	494																WOS:A1988P195800001

The digestive tracts of the young roach were analysed. They fed essentially on rotifers and on cladocerans. For comparison, zooplankton was also analysed at one littoral area without fish fry. There was an increase of cladoceran density from the vegetated nearshore zone to the offshore zone. Considering the density of Bosmina longirostris, Daphnia longispina, Chydorus sphaericus and Ceriodaphnia quadrangula, we observed a different distribution pattern in the course of the year. In the nearshore zone, the relative abundance of small species, Bosmina and Chydorus, was much higher than that of the larger Daphnia. From April to September, predation pressure mainly affected the smallest species: in contrast to the inshore station without fish fry, the density of Bosmina decreased in May in the littoral with fish. Chydorus was concentrated in the littoral between February and April, then grew into the pelagic zone, where predation pressure obviously was low during the warm season. The number of Daphnia, which was eaten by the fish fry at any time, remained low in the nearshore zone, which suggests that the presence of fish may cause Daphnia to avoid this zone. Ceriodaphnia which was not affected by this predation, was scarce in the nearshore zone during mid-summer. The low density of the cladocerans in the nearshore zone is likely associated with vertebrate predation by roach fry and juveniles, the result of such a process being either a depletion in density of the prey, or an avoidance behaviour.																			0018-8158					DEC 9	1994	294	2					117	128		10.1007/BF00016852	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00016852													WOS:A1994QG90600005
J	BERZINS, B				BERZINS, B			*UBER TEMPERATURBEDINGTE TIERWANDERUNGEN IN DER OSTSEE	OIKOS												The Bay of Riga has very special hydrographic conditions during the summer. There is little water exchange with the Baltic Sea and the water shows several characteristics usually found in lakes. Thus there is a sharp border between the warm surface water of approx. 15 m. depth and the cold bottom-waters. The thermal gradient is often as large as 15 C[degree] in 0.3m. There is one fish fauna characteristic of the warm layers and another cold-stenothermal one. Also there are some few semipelagic spp. which are regularly found in highest numbers in the narrow zone of thermocline (trophic, not thermic factor). Sometimes winds force the warm surface layer up against one coast, cold water welling up from the depth on the lee-shore. Through the configuration of the coast the water is not only forced to vertical but to horizontal movements too. The sessile littoral fauna in the Bay of Riga is eurythermic, whereas the fishes, and to some extent the crustaceans, follow the movements of the water in both a horizontal and a vertical direction.																			0030-1299	1600-0706					1949	1	1					29	33		10.2307/3565035	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3565035													WOS:A1949YE48300004

Dawson Cut, near Fairbanks, Alaska, provides a 5.2-m-long pollen record of interglacial boreal forest succeeded by shrub tundra and then forest/tundra. Ash Bend, Stewart River, central Yukon, provides a 9.5-m-long record of interglacial boreal forest succeeded by forest/tundra, shrub tundra, and herbaceous tundra. The replacement of forest at both sites by more open or tundra vegetation indicates warm interglacial conditions giving way to cold and and climate. It is not clear whether stage 7 was warmer than the present. The warm-cool-warm climate oscillation evident at both sites may correlate to Lake Baikal substages 7a, 7b, and 7c.

Budgeting internal and external nutrient loads in a shallow freshwater bay: Disentangling bioturbator-mediated and net ambient nutrient fluxes	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Shallow embayments are particularly vulnerable to eutrophication and harmful algal blooms (HABs). Most management efforts focus on reducing external nutrient (i.e., nitrogen [N] and phosphorus [P]) loading from landscape runoff, yet seasonal HABs persist. When external loads are lessened, the internal loading of nutrients may contribute to continued eutrophic conditions. We investigated internal loading, including the contribution of bioturbator-mediated sediment-surface water nutrient exchange, in Sandusky Bay, OH, USA, the largest embayment in Lake Erie. Sediment-surface water nutrient fluxes are driven by oxygen conditions, geochemical processes, and microbial nutrient processes. Invertebrate bioturbation can modify nutrient fluxes by transporting oxygenated surface water through burrows, into normally anoxic sediment, which can alter abiotic nutrient flux rates (i.e., via phosphorus sorption) and promote microbial nutrient processing (i.e., nitrogen transformations). We measured benthic invertebrate densities monthly across Sandusky Bay and quantified bioturbation-driven and ambient nutrient flux rates through intact sediment core experiments. We assessed the contribution of bioturbation to net ambient nutrient fluxes and compared internal loads (ambient and bioturbation-mediated) to external loads. Net ambient phosphorus and nitrogen fluxes varied across time, space, and oxygen conditions. Invertebrate bioturbation contributed to net internal fluxes, and internal phosphorus loads were similar in magnitude to external phosphorus loads while internal nitrogen loads were much smaller than external loads in Sandusky Bay during mid-summer. We demonstrate that invertebrates contribute greatly to internal fluxes and that dynamic bioturbation and ambient nutrient fluxes at the sediment-water interface of shallow bays contribute to internal loading in freshwater aquatic ecosystems.

J	Burniston, D; Dove, A; Backus, S; Thompson, A				Burniston, Debbie; Dove, Alice; Backus, Sean; Thompson, Aaron			Nutrient concentrations and loadings in the St. Clair River-Detroit River Great Lakes Interconnecting Channel	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Long-term (2001-2015) water quality monitoring data for the St. Clair River are presented with data from studies in the Detroit River in 2014 and 2015 to provide the most complete information available about nutrient concentrations and loadings in the Lake Huron-Lake Erie interconnecting corridor. Concentrations of total phosphorus (TP) in the St. Clair River have reflected declines in Lake Huron. We demonstrate that St. Clair River TP concentrations are higher than offshore Lake Huron values. The recent average (2014 and 2015) incoming TP load from the upstream Great Lakes is measured here to be 980 metric tonnes per annum (MTA), which is roughly three times greater than previous estimates. Significant TP load increases are also indicated along the St. Clair River. We treat the lower Detroit River as three channels to sample water quality as part of a two year monitoring campaign that included winter sampling and SRP in the parameter suite. We found concentrations of many parameters are higher near the shorelines, with the main Mid-River channel resembling water quality upstream measured at the mouth of the St. Clair River. Comparison with past estimates indicates both concentrations and loadings of TP have dramatically declined since 2007 in the Trenton Channel, while those in the Mid-River and in the Amherstburg Channel have remained similar or have possibly increased. The data demonstrate that the TP load exiting the mouth of the Detroit River into Lake Erie is currently in the range of 3740 (in 2014) to 2610 (2015) MTA.

BULLETIN DE LA SOCIETE GEOLOGIQUE DE FRANCE												In France, the basement domains are incised by large fluvial valley networks. Recent studies [Lefebvre et al., 1994, Bonnet, 1998; Lautridou et al., 1999 Antoine et al., 2000; Bonnet et al., 2000] show that these networks were cut during the Pleistocene in response to the uplift of western Europe combined with a fall of the base level [Haq et al., 1987; Shackleton, 1987]. The aim of this article is to study one of the rare Pleistocene sedimentary accumulations preserved in the Armorican Massif, the Penestin fluvial channel system in order to : (1) reconstitute the paleogeomorphological parameters and (2) discuss its relationships with recent tectonic movements. The Penestin fluvial system is localized at the top of the cliff of the Mine d'Or beach (west of Penestin, south of the Vilaine estuary, fig. 1). The paleochannel cuts through the Carboniferous micaschists which pass laterally into Tertiary paleoweathering deposits. The paleochannel is deformed by folds and/or by strike-slipe faults. Three sectors are identified (fig. 2). Sector 1 : a northern undeformed sub-area; sector 2 : an intermediate slightly folded sub-area; sector 3 a southern folded and faulted sub-area. Three sedimentological units and seven associated facies are distinguished. Unit I (facies G), containing local matrix-dominated conglomerates characteristic of distal debris flows, suggests a proximal braided river environment, near the transition with alluvial fans [Blair and Mac Pherson, 1994]. Paleocurrent trends are directed toward N320 (fig. 3). Unit II (facies Sg, Sgm, Sf, Fb and T) is mainly dominated by sandy facies and corresponds to a more distal braided river flooded at the top by the sea (occurrence of inner estuarine deposits). The 2D and 3D megaripple cross-bedding structures indicate paleocurrents trending N320 (fig. 3). Unit III (facies G, Sg, Sgm and Fr) with multiple erosive channels is filled by braided river deposits (facies G, Sg and Sgm) or temporary lake sediments (facies Fr). The 2D and 3D megaripple cross-bedding structures indicate paleocurrents oriented N135 or N180 (fig, 3), Stratigraphically, these three units record two major base level cycles (fig. 6), in the sense of Wheeler [1958]. The first base level fall corresponds to the incision of the paleochannel. Unit I is amalgamated and was deposited during the beginning of the rise, while unit II corresponds to the maximal facies preservation during the maximum rate of rise. The erosion of unit Il by unit III corresponds to a moderate base level fall followed by a small rise (little preservation of unit III). The basement, the weathering deposits and the Quaternary sedimentary units are folded and faulted by N050 to N070 strike-slip faults (fig. 2). Two stages of deformation can be characterized. The first stage, taking place before the incision of the paleochannel, corresponds to a southward tilting of the weathering profile. The second stage took place during the paleochannel infilling. producing thickness variations of the bedsets within unit II. The amount of deformation increased during deposition of unit III and is expressed by N050 to N070 strike-slip faults capped by unit III or by a topmost erosive surface. Fault orientation indicates a NNW-SSE compression (fig. 5) consistent with the stress. field in northwestern Europe [Muller et al., 1992 : Zoback, 1992]. Paleocurrent directions in units I and II seem to indicate a southerly drainage basin. Today, the Vilaine river flows southward. The units I and II do not represent a paleo-Vilaine river, but since unit III shows paleocurrents similar to those of the present Vilaine river and contains red schists in its basin. It could represent a paleo-Vilaine river. Units I and II might represent a paleo-Loire river, the present Loire river following a curve as it passes over the South Armorican shear zone which reorientates it toward the N320 (fig. 7). Tourenq and Pomerol [1995] show that the Loire river was captured many times ago by the Seine river during the Pleistocene. In this way, when the paleo-Loire river was captured, the paleo-Vilaine river deposited unit III. The Penestin paleochannel resulted from the fluviatile incision/filling of a braided river, which was temporarily overlain by estuarine deposits. The rivers filling this paleochannel first flowed out to the north (flow of a paleo-Loire river : units I and II), and then to the south (flow of a paleo-Vilaine river : unit III). The deformation is attributed to a N110 fault, to a set of N050 and N070 faults and to N050 folds.

The 5 x 2 km large and 26 m deep lake is of proglacial origin and situated on the eastern flank of Sredinny Ridge at the northwestern end of the Central Kamchatka Valley, outside the direct influence of active volcanism. Here, we present results of a multi-proxy study on sediment cores, spanning about the last 7000 years. The general tenor of the TYL record is an increase in continentality and winter snow cover in conjunction with a decrease in temperature, humidity, and biological productivity after 5000-4500 cal yrs BP, inferred from pollen and diatom data and the isotopic composition of organic carbon. The TYL proxy data also show that the late Holocene was punctuated by two colder spells, roughly between 4500 and 3500 cal yrs BP and between 1000 and 200 cal yrs BP, as local expressions of the Neoglacial and Little Ice Age, respectively. These environmental changes can be regarded as direct and indirect responses to climate change, as also demonstrated by other records in the regional terrestrial and marine realm. Long-term climate deterioration was driven by decreasing insolation, while the short-term climate excursions are best explained by local climatic processes. The latter affect the configuration of atmospheric pressure systems that control the sources as well as the temperature and moisture of air masses reaching Kamchatka. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Kenneth			Temperature-mediated differences in bacterial kidney disease expression and survival in Renibacterium salmoninarum-challenged bull trout and other salmonids	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Resource managers considering restoration and reconnection of watersheds to protect and enhance threatened populations of bull trout Salvelinus confluentus have little information about the consequences of bacterial kidney disease (BKD) caused by Renibacterium salmoninartan. To better understand the response of bull trout to R. salmoninarum challenge, we conducted several laboratory experiments at two water temperatures. The extent, severity, and lethality of BKD in bull trout were compared with those of similarly challenged lake trout S. nantaycush, Arctic char S. alpinus, Chinook salmon Ont orhynchus tshawytscha, and rainbow trout O. mykiss. The lethal dose of bacterial cells necessary to induce 50% monality (LD50) was 10-fold lower at the 15 degrees C challenge than at the 9 degrees C challenge. Of the species tested, bull trout were relatively resistant to BKD, Arctic char were the most susceptible among Salvelinus species, and Chinook salmon were the most susceptible among Oncorhynchus species tested. Mean time to death was more rapid for all fish tested at 15 degrees C than for fish challenged at 9 degrees C. These results suggest that infection of bull trout with BKD likely poses a low risk to successful restoration of threatened populations.																			0275-5947					MAY	2007	27	2					695	706		10.1577/M06-002.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/M06-002.1													WOS:000246970200031

Bark canker disease on walnut in Hungary	II International Workshop on Bacterial Diseases of Stone Fruits and Nuts	Acta Horticulturae				2nd International Workshop on Bacterial Diseases of Stone Fruits and Nuts	APR 21-24, 2015	Izmir, TURKEY	Int Soc Horticultural Sci				During August 2012, vertical oozing cankers have been observed on trunks and branches of walnut trees (Juglans regia) in the city of Zanka, near Lake Balaton and other parts of Hungary. Cankers were observed on trunks and branches, where brown-to-black exudates staining appeared on the bark mainly in the summer. The causative agent, a bacterium was first reported in California (Wilson et al., 1957), and was also recorded in Iran, Spain, France and several Italian locations from walnut trees. The bacteria were isolated from walnut trees. The pathogens were identified with classical (morphological, biochemical and physiological properties, pathogenicity test), and molecular (16S rRNA) methods. For molecular identification of the pathogen the 16S rDNA amplification was performed from strain Bn-WalnutZa-Hun1 with a universal bacterial primer. The sequence was deposited in NCBI GenBank (Accession No. HF936707) and showed 99% sequence identity with B. nigrifluens strains. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a natural outbreak of bacterial bark canker on walnut in Hungary and presence of the pathogen may seriously influence in local orchards and garden production in the future. This appearance may have serious consequences for the future walnut production in Hungary.					; Palkovics, Laszlo/AAY-1816-2021; Bujdoso, Geza/AAZ-8796-2020	Palkovics, Laszlo/0000-0002-1850-6750; Karacs-Vegh, Anita/0000-0002-5942-038X													0567-7572		978-94-62611-40-5				2016	1149						47	51		10.17660/ActaHortic.2016.1149.9	http://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2016.1149.9													WOS:000392713600009

Unusually high Deca-BDE concentrations and new flame retardants in a Canadian Arctic top predator, the glaucous gull	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Despite a sustained effort in surveying flame retardants (FRs) in wildlife from industrialized regions, their occurrence in birds or any other wildlife species spanning the Arctic regions, particularly in North America, has received limited attention. This study investigated in the top predator glaucous gull (Larus hyperboreus) breeding in the Eastern Canadian Arctic (Cape Dorset, Nunavut) a comprehensive suite of FRs including unstudied halogenated and non-halogenated FRs of potential health concern, along with legacy organochlorines and mercury. The influence of diet acquired locally and in wintering areas on the tissue contaminant profiles was also investigated using delta N-15 and delta C-13 signatures in liver and feathers. The principal constituent in the Deca-brominated diphenyl ether (BDE) mixture, BDE-209, was remarkably the most concentrated PBDE congener determined in liver samples of Eastern Canadian Arctic glaucous gulls. This suggests dietary exposure from the local marine food web and perhaps also from nearby community landfills. Moreover, this study revealed for the first time the presence of 16 emerging halogenated and non-halogenated FRs in glaucous gulls from this Arctic region including HBB, DDC-CO (anti and syn isomers), PBEB, EHTBB, BEHTBP as well as a series of organophosphate esters (OPEs) (TCEP, TCIPP, TPP, TDCIPP, TDBPP, TBNP, TBOEP, TBEP, TCrP, EHDPP, and TEHP). With the exception of BDE-209, concentrations of other halogenated FRs and organochlorines were found to be in the lower range in liver of Eastern Canadian Arctic glaucous gulls compared to individuals from other circumpolar populations (Svalbard and Greenland). Mercury and methylmercury concentrations, however, were greater than reported elsewhere for glaucous gull populations. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Using data collected by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Great Lakes National Program Office's Long-Term Biology and Water Quality Monitoring Programs, we analyzed the impacts of the hypoxia-induced declines in Dreissena densities in the central basin of Lake Erie on major water chemistry and physical parameters. Our analysis revealed that the decline in Dreissena density in the central basin was concomitant with a decrease in spring dissolved silica concentrations and an increase in total phosphorus and near bottom turbidity not seen in the western or eastern basins. In contrast, opposite patterns in water quality were observed in the eastern basin which was characterized by a high and relatively stable Dreissena population. We are the first to report on observations suggesting that dreissenid-related shifts in water quality may be reversible by documenting that the sharp decline of Dreissena in the central basin of lake Erie was concomitant with a shift from clear to turbid water.

Fish remains, originating from the Nile River, Mediterranean Sea, Red Sea, and the Lake of Galilee, are regularly found in excavations of Jerusalem. Jerusalem's nearest water source, the Gihon spring, does not allow for fish habitation, therefore the remains of fish represent trade imports. The aim of this paper is to assess the production and trade of fish through the lens of new assemblages from the City of David, in Area D3, and from the Givati Parking Lot excavations, in Area 10, dating to the 8th through 2nd centuries BCE. These finds also allowed us to explore production and consumption within ancient urban centers that engaged in long-distance commerce. These assemblages, paired with previously published assemblages, allow for an in-depth diachronic perspective of fish consumption and trade. Results of this research indicate that production techniques varied by species and that trade was sustained after the destruction of the city in 586 BCE. It also attests to changes in trade and consumption as a reaction to political and cultural changes in the Hellenistic, Roman, and Byzantine periods.

Ingestion rates rose exponentially with increasing temperature between 9 and 19.degree. C (Q10 = 2.19, 95% Cl 2.09-2.29) and rose asymptotically with sestion concentration (range 0.7-30 mg .cntdot. L-1). Small larvae were more sensitive to variations in seston concentration than older instars. The type of particles offered also influenced the ingestion rate of larvae. Once corrected for body size, water temperature, and seston concentration, the data show that larvae ingested more of the natural seston and of a yeast suspension than of suspensions containing kaolinite. Ingestion rates of other simuliid species generally co-occurring at the outflow of lakes in early summer were of the same magnitude as those of S. venustum/verecundum, although significant differences were detected among species. Specific ingestion rates of simuliids decline with increasing mass, are similar to those measured for the benthic detritivores, and tend to be higher than those of marine and freshwater zooplankton of similar size. The models are discussed with respect to black fly control with particulate larvicides.

Here, we contribute proxy-data inferring climate and vegetation changes over the past 1600 years, assessing in parallel inorganic and organic chemical analyses on a sediment core from Ladybird wetland, eastern Lesotho. Several proxies were used to determine changes in local vegetation dynamics, productivity, hydrology ((13) C, (15) N, C/N, TOC) and the input and source of the detrital components (Ca/Ti, CIA). The first part of the multi-proxy record (AD 400-800) shows stable terrestrial conditions and low detrital input, followed by higher variability in almost all proxies between ca. AD 900 and 1200. The (13) C record infers a higher proportion of C-4 vegetation, tentatively associated with higher temperatures during this phase, coeval with the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA). After AD 1200, local conditions change gradually from purely terrestrial, towards the typical wetland environment prevailing today. A higher proportion of C-3 plants and possibly an increase in aquatic organisms within the organic matrix corresponds with decreasing detrital input, suggesting locally high available moisture in this part of Lesotho during the Little Ice Age (LIA). Although age-model constraints impedes a robust regional comparison, the inferred climate variability is discussed as a tentative response to enhanced mid-latitude cyclonic activity during LIA, and the variable MCA climate conditions as indirectly dictated by changes in solar activity.

A CASE-STUDY OF THE EFFECTS ON REGIONAL AND SYNOPTIC-SCALE WEATHER SYSTEMS	BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY												A high-resolution numerical model is employed to examine effects of the Great Lakes aggregate, defined to be the five major Great Lakes, on regional and synoptic-scale weather. Simulations wherein the effects of the lakes are included and then excluded are performed on a selected cold air outbreak episode during late autumn when the lakes are still ice-free. Examination of the differences between the model simulations reveals that several dynamical effects result from heating and moistening by the lake aggregate. These effects are manifested primarily in the form of a 4-km-deep, 2000-km-wide, lake-aggregate mesoscale disturbance (circulation) that develops slowly over the region. The simulated lake-aggregate circulation splits a synoptic-scale high into two distinct centers and redirects and intensifies a weak synoptic-scale low, as verified by existing observations. These modifications of the synoptic-scale environment result in additional precipitation over, downstream, and upwind from the lakes. The model simulations also reveal that the developing lake-aggregate circulation influences significantly the lake shore surface winds. In some locations, the surface winds switch from onshore to offshore or vice versa. Because it is well known from observations that the location and orientation of lake-induced snow bands are very sensitive to the low-level wind direction over the lakes, it is concluded that the exact locations of heavy snowfall are the result of a complex multiscale interaction among circulations on three different scales: synoptic, individual lake, and lake aggregate. In addition to the developing primary lake-aggregate circulation, a secondary dynamic response appears at a distant location, adjacent to the eastern seaboard. The organization of this secondary circulation suggests that the lakes may play a direct role in some cases of East Coast cyclogenesis.																			0003-0007					OCT	1994	75	10					1793	1811		10.1175/1520-0477(1994)075<1793:LAMDPI>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0477(1994)075<1793:LAMDPI>2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1994PN88600003

A stable isotope record of Holocene precipitation dynamics in the Baltic region from Lake Nuudsaku, Estonia	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												A long-term perspective of past hydroclimate variability for the Baltic region provides important context for evaluating the potential impacts of Northern Hemisphere temperature changes and shifting ocean atmospheric interactions on northern European climate. Lake Nuudsaku is an open-basin lake in south-central Estonia with seasonal overflow fed by active springs and groundwater. Stable isotope analyses of surface water samples from regional lakes, rivers, wetlands, and precipitation indicate that Lake Nuudsaku water delta O-18 values are consistent with the isotopic composition of inflowing meteoric water. The isotopic composition of fine-grained (< 63 mu m) endogenic CaCO3 (delta O-18(caicite)) samples from Lake Nuudsaku vary between similar to 14 to-9 parts per thousand(VPBD) over the last similar to 9400 years. Based on sensitivity tests, we interpret the delta O-18(calcite) variations from Lake Nuudsaku as a record of meteoric inputs; principally reflecting variations in the seasonality of precipitation, with temperature changes as a secondary influence. The delta O-18(calcite) record indicates the early Holocene at similar to 9400 calendar years before present (cal yr BP) was characterized by a high proportion of cold season (November through April) precipitation and lower temperatures, followed by waning cold season precipitation and higher temperatures until similar to 8200 cal yr BP. The middle Holocene (8200-4200 cal yr BP) was likely a period of overall reduced cold season precipitation and higher temperatures, and/or increased warm season (May through October) precipitation. The late Holocene transition at similar to 4200 cal yr BP generally marks a shift to lower delta O-18(calcite) values that we interpret largely the result of increased cold season precipitation amounts. This was followed by the onset of more variable precipitation amounts and temperatures after similar to 3600 cal yr BP, which gave way to less variable conditions during the last similar to 2600 years. The Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) is marked by delta O-18(calcite) values that are near the Holocene and present-day averages. The period spanning the Little Ice Age (LIA) is marked by low delta O-18(calcite) values, suggesting temperatures were lower and cold season conditions were wetter than present-day. Proxy evidence from Lake Nuudsaku further indicates that centennial to millennial-scale hydroclimate shifts in the Baltic region were likely associated with changes in North Atlantic ocean-atmospheric circulation dynamics.

Samples were collected quarterly between December 2012 and December 2014. Study focus: There is increasing concern about the health effects of manganese in drinking water, prompting interest in understanding manganese dynamics. This study investigated the temporal and spatial patterns of metals and nutrients, as influenced by summer rainfall; and the impacts of those variables on drinking water, associated infrastructure and concomitant health risks. New hydrological insights for region: Results show that the hydrogeochemistry of Baffle Creek was predominantly driven by rain events, with differing responses to varying magnitudes of rain and discharge. Following a flushing event, dissolved aluminium and nitrate increased in the surface and drinking water, whereas manganese and ammonia were undetectable in the drinking water and occurred only in small concentrations in the surface waters. In contrast, when rainfall events occurred without an associated flush, manganese, iron and ammonia concentrations increased in the drinking water. The hydrochemistry of manganese and iron in the supply chain infrastructure was strongly positively correlated with ammonia, and aluminium correlated with nitrate concentrations. Currently the drinking water supply does not pose a threat to chronic manganese exposure for humans, however elevated concentrations are experienced periodically; and may become more problematic under climate change scenarios.

The study was conducted during January to December 2021. A total of 360 Nile tilapia were sampled from Lake Hawassa and subjected to bacteriological investigations. The results showed 64.2% prevalence of bacterial infection in Nile tilapia from the lake. Potential bacterial pathogens such as Aeromonas hydrophila, Escherichia coli, Edwardsiella tarda, Vibrio sp,, Bacillus sp., Staphylococcus sp., Salmonella sp., Flavobacterum sp., Pseudomonas sp. and Shigella sp. were isolated. The prevalence of infection in female fish (52.4%) was higher compared to male fish (47.6%). Comparatively higher prevalence was recorded in the smaller fish group than in the larger ones. The average bacterial loads recorded in various organs such as intestine, skin, gill, liver and kidney were, 4.86 +/- 0.56 x 105, 4.72 +/- 0.48 x 105, 4.14 +/- 0.53 x 105, 3.45 +/- 0.23 x 105 and 2.63 +/- 0.324 x 105 CFU ml-1 respectively. Significantly high bacterial loads were recorded from the intestine (5.81 +/- 0.01 x 105 CFU ml-1) of fish during the summer season (p < 0.05). The results of the study indicated that there is a risk of occurrence of disease outbreak under stressful situations. Moreover, the recovery of these bacteria in the fish which are potentially pathogenic to humans, suggests that if the fish are improperly handled, undercooked or consumed raw, may cause diseases to susceptible individuals.																			0970-6011						2023	70	4					134	141		10.21077/ijf.2023.70.4.129958-14	http://dx.doi.org/10.21077/ijf.2023.70.4.129958-14													WOS:001137449100016

Planktonic larvae of the invasive bivalves Dreissena spp. and Limnoperna fortunei: review of their effects on freshwater communities	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Dreissena polymorpha, Dreissena rostriformis bugensis, and Limnoperna fortunei are considered among the most invasive freshwater mussels. The three species share several biological and ecological traits, resulting in often similar effects on the ecosystems. Their planktonic larvae ("veligers" s.l.) can be a dominant component of the summer zooplankton community. The development from fertilized egg to juvenile normally takes 10-20 days, but only < 1-3% of the fertilized eggs reach the settling stage. Consumption of veligers by invertebrates is likely high, but so far largely unexplored. Predation by larval fishes has been more intensively studied. In Europe and North America, 23 fish species feed on dreissenid veligers, whereas in South America ca. 28 consume L. fortunei veligers. Their importance in fish diets varies widely, but in several cases, veligers represent their main or even only source of food. Further, some species perform significantly better when fed veliger-rich diets, than diets with low veliger densities. Mussel larvae have been reported to feed on particles 1-15 mu m in size, as well as on dissolved organic carbon, at clearance rates similar to 10 to > 400 mu L/veliger/day. Their competitive impact on other filter-feeding organisms can potentially be significant, but data at hand suggest that usually it is minor.

J	Campbell, CE; Knoechel, R; Copeman, D				Campbell, CE; Knoechel, R; Copeman, D			Evaluation of factors related to increased zooplankton biomass and altered species composition following impoundment of a Newfoundland reservoir	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Zooplankton biomass and species composition were monitored in Cat Arm Lake and Reservoir on Newfoundland's Great Northern Peninsula from 1983 to 1993. Zooplankton biomass increased approximately 19-fold in the oligotrophic reservoir following impoundment in 1984, relative to biomass in the preexisting lake. Microcrustaceans Cyclops scutifer and Daphnia dubia, either rare or absent from Cat Arm Lake prior to impoundment, were consistently measurable components of the zooplankton community by 1993. Similar changes elsewhere have been attributed to both increased water retention time and enhanced phytoplankton biomass, factors whose effects are usually interdependent. In Cat Arm, there were no increases in either phytoplankton biomass or primary productivity during the first 3 years of impoundment, and natality of the dominant cladoceran, Daphnia catawba, did not increase. Summer water retention time increased from preimpoundment levels of 4 days in 1983 to 338 days in 1993. Zooplankton biomass was significantly correlated with water retention time (Spearman's r(s) = 0.72, p = 0.04) and showed no significant correlation with phytoplankton biomass, primary productivity, nutrient concentrations, pH, colour, or epilimnetic temperature. Changes in the zooplankton community in this subarctic system can thus be attributed most directly to a decrease in losses due to washout.

Drinking water systems are supplied with different types of groundwater, springs, and surface water sources (from lakes and rivers) whose availability and quality can be affected by climate change events. A multidisciplinary team, in collaboration with the University of Milano Bicocca, developed a specific Water Safety Plan (WSP) risk matrix focusing on the evaluation of climate-related hazardous events and calculation of their likelihood of occurrence, also using thematic maps. Moreover, to reduce the residual risks, in the risk matrix, possible control measures are suggested, such as the activation of an emergency plan, the use of other water sources, storage tanks, and interconnection with other water distribution networks. This work shows a simple and effective tool that can be applied by drinking water utilities to evaluate climate-related catchment risks, using a WSP risk matrix, thematic maps, and possible control measures to reduce risks in terms of water quality and availability and to respond with resilience to changes.

Typically, freshwater and marine species are not closely related, indicating an ancient divergence and that salinity poses a strong dispersal barrier. Here we reveal a common recent origin of two dinoflagellates that are well adapted to different habitats. Gymnodinium baicalense inhabits the geologically old freshwater Lake Baikal, which is located in the middle of the Eurasian continent. Gymnodinium corollarium, on the other hand, is a brackish water species from the Baltic Sea. Both species form blooms under ice during the spring. We generated 10 DNA sequences from these species. The partial 28S rRNA gene from G. baicalense and the partial 18S rRNA gene and internal transcribed spacer-2 (ITS2) from G. corollarium were sequenced for the first time. A more detailed description of G. baicalense, which was previously known only from light microscopy observations, is also provided. In the laboratory we demonstrated that G. baicalense is strictly adapted to fresh water, while G. corollarium had a wide salinity tolerance. However, the two species have almost identical morphology, identical SSU rRNA gene sequences, and only small differences in the LSU rRNA gene and ITS2. We infer a common ancestor, which was a species from the Arctic region with a tolerance to a range of salinities. Our data support the scenario that the under-ice phytoplankton community in Lake Baikal has been formed recently, even though the lake is the oldest in the world.

J	Kovacic, G; Ravbar, N				Kovacic, Gregor; Ravbar, Natasa			Extreme hydrological events in karst areas of Slovenia, the case of the Unica River basin	GEODINAMICA ACTA												The study presents natural hazards in Slovenia's karst, focusing on flooding in karst poljes. A specific study was done on the flood dynamics of two typical and connected karst poljes (Cerknica and Planina) of the Classical Karst region. In the case of particularly extreme hydrological conditions in the autumn of 2008, detailed analyses of the recharge-discharge regime and the interrelationship of flooding on the two poljes were clone. Daily precipitation, discharge, and water level values from several monitoring sites were analyzed and cross-correlated, and additional hydrological analyses were done using a digital elevation model in order to acquire water level increase and decrease intensity, flood water volumes, and the extent of flooding and to understand the conditions controlling karst flooding. The results reveal that the hydrological functioning of the studied karst poljes is influenced by the hydrogeological and temporary hydrological conditions in the catchment area. The response of the binary karst system (i.e., the influence of autogenic and allogenic recharge) is especially distinct. The study shows that during extremely intense recharge, the reactions of karst aquifer systems to precipitation are as rapid as the response of surface waters (the water level of Cerknica Lake increased with an intensity of 38-63 cm/day or 55 m(3)/s respectively) while retention capacities are negligible. In contrast to flash floods, floods in karst areas may last from several weeks to several months. For the observed period a three-dimensional simulation of the flooding was made. At the maximum recorded water level, the volume of water on the Cerknica polje was 51 million m(3), and 26 million m(3) on the Planina polje. The maximum extent of flooding on the Cerknica polje was 23 km(2) and on the Planina polje 9.5 km(2). On the basis of the study, information was provided regarding future hazard mitigation. However, the study demonstrated that a sufficiently dense monitoring network is necessary to predict the occurrence and duration of floods with greater certainty. (C) 2010 Lavoisier SAS.

Current knowledge on the regional control and variability of below ice partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO(2)) is lacking, creating a gap in our understanding of how ice cover dynamics affect the CO2 accumulation below ice and therefore CO2 emissions from inland waters during the ice-melt period. To narrow this gap, we identified the drivers of below ice pCO(2) variation across 506 Swedish and Finnish lakes using water chemistry, lake morphometry, catchment characteristics, lake position, and climate variables. We found that lake depth and trophic status were the most important variables explaining variations in below ice pCO(2) across the 506 lakes(.) Together, lake morphometry and water chemistry explained 53% of the site-to-site variation in below ice pCO(2). Regional climate (including ice cover duration) and latitude only explained 7% of the variation in below ice pCO(2). Thus, our results suggest that on a regional scale a shortening of the ice cover period on lakes may not directly affect the accumulation of CO2 below ice but rather indirectly through increased mobility of nutrients and carbon loading to lakes. Thus, given that climate-induced changes are most evident in northern ecosystems, adequately predicting the consequences of a changing climate on future CO2 emission estimates from northern lakes involves monitoring changes not only to ice cover but also to changes in the trophic status of lakes.					; Weyhenmeyer, Gesa/Y-6135-2019; Kortelainen, Pirkko/AAN-7045-2020	Rantakari, Miitta Maria/0000-0003-2335-6192; Kortelainen, Pirkko/0000-0002-1448-0688; 													1432-9840	1435-0629				APR	2016	19	3					461	476		10.1007/s10021-015-9944-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-015-9944-z													WOS:000373018200007
J	Moreno, PI				Moreno, PI			Millennial-scale climate variability in northwest Patagonia over the last 15000 yr	JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE												A pollen record from Lago Condorito (41degrees45'S, 73degrees07'W) shows prominent vegetation and climate changes at millennial time-scales, superimposed on multimillennial trends in temperature and westerly activity in northwest Patagonia during the past 15000 yr. The record shows that evergreen temperate rainforests have dominated the landscape over this interval, with floristic changes ranging from cold-resistant North Patagonian forests with podocarp conifers to Valdivian forests with thermophilous, summer-drought resistant species. The long-term trend shows that cool-temperate and humid conditions prevailed between 15000 and 11000 cal. yr BP, followed by an extreme warm and dry phase between 11000 and 7600 cal. yr BP, and subsequent cooling events and increase in precipitation that peaked at ca. 5000 cal. yr BP, when Southern Hemisphere alpine glaciers achieved their first Neoglacial maximum. Modern conditions were established at ca. 1800 cal. yr BP, following a warm and dry phase between ca. 2900 and 1800 cal. yr BP. These results suggest that millennial-scale climate variability during deglacial and post-glacial times also affected the mid-latitude region of the South Pacific, supporting the idea that changes in the tropical Pacific might be a key factor in the initiation and/or propagation of millennial-scale climate variability at regional, hemispheric and global scales.

Leo			Numerical modeling of ice control on the Albany River, Ontario, Canada	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING												The Kashechewan First Nation (KFN) community is located on a floodplain of the north branch of the Albany River, on the west coast of James Bay. Each spring, the community faces the uncertain prospect of evacuation due to ice-jam flooding, the most severe of which occurred in 2006. A study was conducted to develop long-term options for reducing the flood risk to the community, which included dams, dykes, pier and weir type ice-control structures, and conveyance channels. This paper presents a numerical model study on the Albany River in Ontario, Canada to develop ice control as a potential means for mitigating ice-jam flooding at the KFN community using the two-dimensional ice dynamics model DynaRICE. A method was developed to simulate pier type ice-control structures within the model such that the physical channel conditions, flow conditions, and combinations of ice control could be evaluated. The model allowed detailed simulation of ice retention, resulting inundation, and the forces on the individual piers. To optimize the design of the piers, including pier spacing, height, and size, various combinations of ice, flow, and pier conditions were simulated. Numerical modeling facilitated a comparative examination of flood risk reduction to the community from the various ice control options.

Intraseasonal variation of E. coli and environmental covariates in two irrigation ponds in Maryland, USA	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The microbial quality of irrigation water is typically assessed by measuring the concentrations of E. coli in irrigation water reservoirs that are variable in space and time. E. coli concentrations are affected by water quality parameters that co-vary with E. coli concentrations and may be easily measured with currently available sensors. The objective of this work was to identify the most influential environmental covariates affecting E. coli concentrations during a three-month biweekly monitoring period within two irrigation ponds in Maryland during the summer of 2017. E. coli levels as well as sensor-based water quality parameters including turbidity, pH, dissolved oxygen, dissolved fluorescent organic matter, conductivity, and chlorophyll were measured at 23 and 34 locations in ponds 1 and 2, respectively. Regression tree analyses were used to determine the most influential water quality parameters for the prediction of E. coli levels. Correlations between E. coli and water quality covariates were not strong and were inconsistently significant. Shoreline sample locations had higher E. con concentrations than interior pond samples and significant differences were observed when comparing these two groups. Regression trees provided fairly accurate predictions of E. coli levels based on water quality parameters with R-2 values ranging from 0.70 to 0.93. Factors identified via the regression trees varied by sampling date but common leading covariates included cyanobacteria, organic matter, and turbidity. Results indicated environmental covariates, sensed either remotely or in situ, could be useful to delineate areas with different E. coli survival conditions across irrigation ponds and potentially other water bodies such as lakes, rivers, or bays.

J	Maier, MS; Teodoru, CR; Wehrli, B				Maier, Marie-Sophie; Teodoru, Cristian R.; Wehrli, Bernhard			Spatio-temporal variations in lateral and atmospheric carbon fluxes from the Danube Delta	BIOGEOSCIENCES												River deltas, with their mosaic of ponds, channels and seasonally inundated areas, act as the last continental hot spots of carbon turnover along the land-ocean aquatic continuum. There is increasing evidence for the important role of riparian wetlands in the transformation and emission of terrestrial carbon to the atmosphere. The considerable spatial heterogeneity of river deltas, however, forms a major obstacle for quantifying carbon emissions and their seasonality. The water chemistry in the river reaches is defined by the upstream catchment, whereas delta lakes and channels are dominated by local processes such as aquatic primary production, respiration or lateral exchange with the wetlands. In order to quantify carbon turnover and emissions in the complex mosaic of the Danube Delta, we conducted monthly field campaigns over 2 years at 19 sites spanning river reaches, channels and lakes. Here we report on the greenhouse gas fluxes (CO2 and CH4) from the freshwater systems of the Danube Delta and present the first seasonally resolved estimates of its freshwater carbon emissions to the atmosphere. Furthermore, we quantify the lateral carbon transport of the Danube River to the Black Sea. We estimate the delta's CO2 and CH4 emissions to be 65 GgC yr(-1) (30-120 GgC yr(-1), a range calculated using 25 to 75 percentiles of observed fluxes), of which about 8% are released as CH4. The median CO2 fluxes from river branches, channels and lakes are 25, 93 and 5.8 mmolm(-2) d(-1), respectively. Median total CH4 fluxes amount to 0.42, 2.0 and 1.5 mmolm(-2) d(-1). While lakes do have the potential to act as CO2 sinks in summer, they are generally the largest emitters of CH4. Small channels showed the largest range in emissions, including a CO2 and CH4 hot spot sustained by adjacent wetlands. Thereby, the channels contribute dispro-portionately to the delta's emissions, considering their limited surface area. In terms of lateral export, we estimate the net total export (the sum of dissolved inorganic carbon, DIC, dissolved organic carbon, DOC, and particulate organic carbon, POC) from the Danube Delta to the Black Sea to be about 160 +/- 280 GgC yr(-1), which only marginally increases the carbon load from the upstream river catchment (8490 +/- 240 GgC yr(-1)) by about 2 %. While this contribution from the delta seems small, deltaic carbon yield (45.6 gCm(-2) yr(-1); net export load/surface area) is about 4 times higher than the riverine carbon yield from the catchment (10.6 gCm(-2) yr(-1)).

After the elections the new government started to revise the policies concerning education and employment. The goal was to raise the number of employed people in Hungary to 4.7 million by the year 2020. In the national labour market there are areas that are unique and employ labour under special circumstances. Such an area is the Lake Balaton Resort Area, the 2nd largest tourist destination in Hungary. The Lake Balaton Resort Area consists of 179 settlements but most of its workforce comes from 43 settlements which have direct access to Lake Balaton. Most of the jobs are seasonal, lasting from May to September. Nowadays we hear from entrepreneurs that they are unable to find workers even though qualifications are not required anymore, because many skilled workers use the opportunities provided by the European Union, and go abroad to work, the primary target being Austria where they work in ski resorts during the winter, or London, where they can find full time jobs and earn wages 5 times that in Hungary. This is the case for the whole region of Balaton even outside the tourism sector. It is important to underline that the labour market in tourism influences the employment situation in all sectors of the region. In this paper I wish to examine how employment rates changed in the lakeshore settlements of the region in 2011, and how much income was generated by tourism employment around the lake. I examine the income generating capacity by the share of personal income tax that local government kept for themselves, and by the value of the income tax per employee, this latter indicator allowing the comparison of the Lake Balaton area to other tourism destinations in Hungary.																			1821-2506						2017	9	1					5	25																WOS:000407001400002

However, accurately assessing CH4 emissions from these lakes remains challenging due to limited observations during lake ice melting periods. In this study, by integrating field surveys with machine learning modeling, we offer a comprehensive assessment of present and future CH4 emissions from thermokarst lakes on the Tibetan Plateau. Our results reveal that the previously underestimated CH4 release from lake ice bubble and water storage during ice melting periods is 11.2 +/- 1.6 Gg C of CH4, accounting for 17 +/- 4% of the annual total release from lakes. Despite thermokarst lakes cover only 0.2% of the permafrost area, they annually emit 65.5 +/- 10.0 Gg C of CH4, which offsets 6.4% of the net carbon sink in alpine grasslands on the plateau. Considering the loss of lake ice, the expansion of thermokarst lakes is projected to lead to 1.1-1.2 folds increase in CH4 emissions by 2100. Our study allows foreseeing future CH4 emissions from the rapid expanding thermokarst lakes and sheds new lights on processes controlling the carbon-climate feedback in alpine permafrost ecosystems.					zhang, chunxiu/KVX-8013-2024; Yunjie, JIA/KJM-1911-2024; Song, Chunlin/AGU-3084-2022; Mu, Cuicui/KBD-1913-2024; peng, xiaoqing/ABE-1509-2021; Zhang, Guofei/LXV-2701-2024	mu, cuicui/0000-0003-0630-9423; 														2041-1723				MAR 11	2025	16	1							2404	10.1038/s41467-025-57745-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-57745-2								40064902					WOS:001441293400001
J	Chen, M; Jiang, HL				Chen, Mo; Jiang, He-Long			Relative contribution of iron reduction to sediments organic matter mineralization in contrasting habitats of a shallow eutrophic freshwater lake	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Iron reduction is one of the important organic matter (OM) mineralization pathway in sediments. Here we investigated the rates and the relative contribution of iron reduction to OM mineralization in Zhushan bay (ZSB, cyanobacterial bloom biomass (CBB)-dominated habitats) and East Taihu Lake (ETL, submerged macrophypes (SM)-dominated habitats) of Lake Taihu, China. Anaerobic microcosm incubation revealed that the rate of iron reduction at ZSB (4.42 mu mol cm(-3) d(-1)) in summer was almost 1.5 times higher than at ETL (3.13 mu mol cm(-3) d(-4)). Iron reduction accounted for 66.5% (ZSB) and 31.8% (ETL) of total anaerobic carbon mineralization, respectively. No detectable methanogenesis was found at ZSB, while methanogenesis was responsible for 16.7% of total anaerobic respiration in sediments of ETL. Geochemical analysis of solid phase constituents indicated that ZSB surface sediments experienced highly oxidizing conditions with much higher amorphous Fe(III) (71 mmol m(-2)) than ETL (11 mmol m(-2)). Conversely, AVS inventories at ETL (38 mmol m(-2)) were up to 30 times higher than at ZSB (1.27 mmol m(-2)), indicating significant sulfate reduction in sediments of ETL. Overall results suggested that varying carbon sources and distinct geochemical characterizations of the sediments in contrasting habitats significantly influenced the rate of iron reduction and the pathway of C mineralization in a large freshwater lake.

J	Theriot, EC; Fritz, SC; Whitlock, C; Conley, DJ				Theriot, EC; Fritz, SC; Whitlock, C; Conley, DJ			Late Quaternary rapid morphological evolution of an endemic diatom in Yellowstone Lake, Wyoming	PALEOBIOLOGY												The centric diatom Stephanodiscus yellowstonensis Theriot and Stoermer is endemic to Yellowstone Lake, where it can be an important component of the summer phytoplankton assemblage. Its close relative, Stephanodiscus niagarae Ehrenberg, is abundant in nearby lakes and regional reservoirs. We used the stratigraphic record of Yellowstone Lake to investigate the evolution of S. niagarae to S. yellowstonensis and to describe the limnologic and climatic conditions associated with its evolution. A dramatic morphological shift took place between about 13.7 and 10.0 Ka, but morphology remained stable from 10 Ka to the present. Coincident with morphological change in the S. niagarae/S. yellowstonensis complex were changes in the diatom species assemblage, biogenic silica concentrations, sediment lithology, and regional vegetation. These changes suggest an environment that experienced progressive warming following the retreat of continental glaciers. We could not identify a specific selective factor driving evolution. Nevertheless, nonrandom morphological evolution strongly associated with continuous environmental change suggests that directional selection is a reasonable hypothesis to account for evolution of S. yellowstonensis. Protists are presumed to evolve gradually after speciation events because of large population size, high dispersal capacity, and low reproductive barriers. However, published diatom examples and the evolution of S. yellowstonensis suggest that it is premature to generalize about rates of evolution in protists, or at least to include diatoms in this generalization.

The valleys are restricted from the mid to the distal ends of the outwash plains and show no connection to possible water sources at the updip end of the plains. Their distribution and morphology lead us to propose that they were eroded by groundwater seeps fed by proglacial lakes (the high hydrostatic heads of the lakes led to the elevation of the water table) dammed by the outwash plains and associated moraines. The valleys on Cape Cod were initiated by seeps along the foreset surfaces of sandy deltas emplaced iii lakes in Nantucket Sound and Cape Cod Bay after these lakes drained. Those on Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket islands were either eroded by seeps at the distal ends of outwash plain wedges emplaced atop the subareal continental shelf South of the islands or along the foreset Surfaces of sandy deltas emplaced on a lake behind a peripheral crustal bulge south of the glacial front. Valley erosion terminated after the lakes were drained and the water table dropped.																			0169-555X					APR	1994	9	2					83	95		10.1016/0169-555X(94)90068-X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0169-555X(94)90068-X													WOS:A1994NH79700001

Soil temperature, rainfall frequency, nutritional status of the soil and species-specific water relations were studied as to their effects on the growth of P. trifoliata L. seedlings. Root development was examined carefully since previous studies had indicated that root growth sufficient to reach a permanent water supply was critical for survival. Growth was stimulated by the temperature and soil-moisture conditions which occur in early spring. Fertilization, especially N and P, strongly stimulated growth. In addition, P. trifoliata produced adventitious roots when buried. Survival of seedlings was not enhanced by any adaptation to conserve water because plant resistances to water flow were typical of mesic species. Consequently, high transpiration rates occur in the sand-dune habitat, increasing the importance of good root growth. If adequate water is available, the high transpiration rates may help the seedling tolerate the high temperatures of this environment. Thus, P. trifoliata seedlings possess no single characteristic that explains their ability to survive in the rigorous dune habitat, but possess many characteristics that contribute to their success.																			0008-4026						1983	61	9					2410	2415		10.1139/b83-265	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/b83-265													WOS:A1983RM17200019

Although Bhutan has not contributed anything to cause climate change, it is facing the brunt of it impact. Bhutan's climate is strongly influenced by the rugged mountainous terrain surrounding it as well as the Indian summer monsoon and changes in climate, which are increasing the vulnerability of vital economic sectors such as agriculture, forestry, and water resources. Climate change also impacts the country's rich biodiversity and fragile community livelihoods through the increased risks of hazardous events such as glacier lake outburst floods, flash floods, droughts, and forest fires. This chapter analyses the impacts of climate change on agricultural livelihoods and associated internal human mobility.

Storm effects on nitrogen flux and longitudinal variability in a river-reservoir system	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												Sustainable management of the nitrogen (N) cycle remains a considerable global challenge that has major implications for aquatic ecosystems. Dams play a critical yet often neglected role in addressing this challenge as they increase hydraulic residence time and denitrification potential. However, during storm events when the majority of N loading occurs, less is known about the effects dams have on N fate and transport processes. Here, we examined the flux of N species and phosphorus (P) and longitudinal profiles of nitrate (NO3-) along a sixth-order river-reservoir system at baseflow and across the falling limb of a multiday, 1-year storm hydrograph. During the storm event, the reservoir reduced total NO3- flux by 19.1% and P flux by 12.7%. On the contrary, ammonium (NH4+) fluxes were 200% higher downstream of the dam in comparison with fluxes into the reservoir, indicating that there was a substantial net export of NH4+ from the reservoir during the storm event. Longitudinally along the river to reservoir transition, a breakpoint of statistical significance was identified, highlighting the sharp contrast between NO3- concentrations within the river and reservoir. Results suggest that frequent storm events such as the one presented here can greatly alter N removal processes in river-reservoir systems. Overall, this study highlights the need to better understand the role that storm events play in river-reservoir N cycling dynamics.																			1535-1459	1535-1467				JUL	2019	35	6					577	586		10.1002/rra.3433	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/rra.3433													WOS:000475987300004
J	Wellborn, GA; Skelly, DK; Werner, EE				Wellborn, GA; Skelly, DK; Werner, EE			Mechanisms creating community structure across a freshwater habitat gradient	ANNUAL REVIEW OF ECOLOGY AND SYSTEMATICS												Lentic freshwater habitats in temperate regions exist along a gradient from small ephemeral ponds to large permanent lakes. This environmental continuum is a useful axis for understanding how attributes of individuals ultimately generate structure at the level of the community. Community structure across the gradient is determined by both (a) physical factors, such as pond drying and winter anoxia, that limit the potential breadth of species distributions, and (b) biotic effects mediated by ecological interactions, principally predation, that determine the realized success of species. Fitness tradeoffs associated with a few critical traits of individuals often form the basis for species turnover along the gradient. Among species that inhabit temporary ponds, distributions are often constrained because traits that enhance developmental rate and competitive ability also increase susceptibility to predators. In permanent ponds, changes in the composition of major predators over the gradient limit distributions of prey species because traits that reduce mortality risk in one region of the gradient cause increased risk in other regions of the gradient. Integrated across the gradient, these patterns in species success generate distinct patterns in community structure. Additionally, spatial heterogeneity among habitats along the gradient and the fitness tradeoffs created by this heterogeneity may hold important evolutionary implications for habitat specialization and lineage diversification in aquatic taxa.

Results showed that mean concentration of As, Cr, Cu, Ni and Zn in sediments, and As in water samples are higher than local background and standard values. Moderate to significant enrichment of As in river and very high enrichment in sediments of pollution hotspots were observed, while Zn, Cr, Cu, Ni and Pb showed low to moderate enrichment. Based on mean probable effect level (PEL) quotient, river and hotspot sediments were classified as slightly toxic and heavily toxic, respectively. Potential ecological risk index (PER) indicated low risk and high risk for river sediments and pollution hotspots, respectively. Based on factor analysis, Moiel iron mine and geothermal/hot springs are the main sources of Cr, Zn, Pb and As. Limonite as a secondary mineral accumulated As from hydrothermal or geothermal sources. Concentrations of As, Cr and Pb in fish muscle samples are higher than liver, while higher Cu, Ni and Zn concentrations observed in liver of fish samples. The MannWhitney U test revealed significant differences in As, Cu and Zn concentrations between different organs. The average target hazard quotient (THQ) in fish muscle followed the order of As > Cr > Cu > Pb > Zn > Ni, and hazard index (HI) values indicate an alarm for public health concern. Consumption of these fish can cause carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic effects for local people and consumers in long term.

J	de Carvalho, RF; do Carmo, JSA				de Carvalho, Rita Fernandes; do Carmo, Jose Simao Antunes			Landslides into reservoirs and their impacts on banks	ENVIRONMENTAL FLUID MECHANICS												Mass wasting processes, like slope failures, on the margins of dam reservoirs, lakes, bays and oceans may generate large water waves that can produce disasters due to flooding over the banks, run up along the shoreline and overtopping dam crests. Therefore, the study of slope failures, the subsequent generation of impulse waves and their consequences are of paramount importance for safety. In this paper the generation and propagation of water waves in reservoirs induced by landslides and their impact on banks were investigated by means of a laboratory study carried out at University of Coimbra wave channel, in a flume measuring 12.0m x 1.5m x 1.0m (L x H x W), where two banks with variable slope were placed. The study considered the sliding of calcareous blocks over a sliding slope bank into the reservoir, the generation of impulse waves, their propagation in the reservoir and their impact on the downstream bank. A number of waves were generated by different fallings of calcareous blocks, considering different volumes, sliding slopes, initial positions and reservoir depths. All fallings were recorded by video-camera and the results were processed afterwards to obtain the time history of the falling. The water surface variations due to transient waves were measured at five gauges placed between the banks. The waves overtopping and breaking on the downstream bank were also filmed using a video camera, and the hydrodynamic forces on this bank were also measured using four pressure transducers.

Cases used in the study showed a continuum from small-scale to large-scale and did not fall clearly into two clusters. Yields (per fisherman or per boat) increased significantly with increasing investment but so did fuel use. There was no statistical difference in fuel energy efficiency between the 8 smaller- and the 8 large-scale fisheries in the sample; the overall mean was 2.4 tons of fish yield per ton of fuel used and many fisheries were within the relatively narrow range of 1-3 tons. Results suggested that many small-scale fisheries are not as energy efficient as postulated by some researches. This may be partially explained by the dependence of many small-scale fisheries on outboard engines. The 8 smaller fisheries provided about 10 times as many jobs per dollar invested as the 8 larger ones, but the yield per fisherman in the larger fisheries was about 10 times higher.					; falaykislalioglu, merve/OMM-4996-2025	Berkes, Fikret/0000-0001-8402-121X; 													0165-7836	1872-6763				MAY	1989	7	3					207	224		10.1016/0165-7836(89)90055-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0165-7836(89)90055-6													WOS:A1989AF05100002

By suspending the oxide at different pH values and measuring solution concentrations of Ca2+, inorganic phosphate and organic matter, it was found that most of each of these components can be released from the oxide without affecting particle morphology. However little release of Si could be induced. Oxygenation experiments with model lakewaters initially containing Fe(II) confirmed the finding of U. Schwertmann et al. (1984) that the presence of Si(OH)4 leads to the formation of ferrihydrite, otherwise the oxidation product is lepidocrocite. The model lakewaters did not yield "large particles", instead the material consisted of small units a few nm in diameter. Oxygenation experiments with filtered (0.22 .mu.m) and unfiltered natural waters showed that the formation of "large particles" requires the presece of natural particulate matter. However, biological poisons (azide, formalin) did not affect particle formation, which suggests that living organisms are not involved.

This study explores seasonal and spatial variations in the diet composition of Labeo gonius in relation to physico-chemical parameters and plankton abundance in Chashma Lake, Pakistan. Monthly sampling from 2022 to 2023 was conducted at three ecologically distinct sites to assess water quality, phytoplankton, macrophytes, zooplankton, and fish gut content. Significant seasonal and spatial fluctuations in temperature, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, and nutrient levels influenced the availability of food resources. Spatially, variations in plankton and macrophyte abundance were associated with nutrient input, water depth, and habitat complexity. Phytoplankton diversity peaked in summer, dominated by Bacillariophyta, followed by Chlorophyta, Cyanophyta, and aquatic macrophytes such as Chara and Hydrilla. Zooplankton consumption was minimal, with Daphnia and Cyclops being the most frequently consumed taxa. Correlation analysis revealed that seasonal changes in temperature and nutrient availability significantly influenced the abundance of phytoplankton, macrophytes, and zooplankton, which in turn affected feeding behavior (p < 0.05). Multivariate analyses showed that both fish size and site location significantly influenced diet composition, with larger individuals consuming more macrophytes (p < 0.05). These findings highlight the flexible, environmentally responsive feeding behavior of L. gonius and improve understanding of its trophic ecology. This knowledge can guide sustainable fisheries management through optimized stocking schedules, habitat-specific conservation efforts, and nutrient regulation strategies.

Influence of Environmental Factors on the Dynamics of Zooplankton in Lake Kulunda (Western Siberia)	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												The results of studying the influence of the main natural environmental factors on the interannual (2017-2021) and seasonal (from April to October) zooplankton dynamics of the large hypersaline Lake Kulunda located in the Kulunda steppe (Altai krai, Russia) are presented. The relationship of 13 main indicators of the structure of zooplankton (number and biomass in total, the main taxonomic groups: rotifers, copepods, cladocerans, and branchiopods, as well as different stages of the life cycle of Artemia) with the main hydrophysical and hydrochemical indicators (temperature, density, salinity, and pH of water) was analyzed separately by monthly and average annual (for the growing season) values. The influence of the studied factors on the characteristics of the brine shrimp population (number, biomass, and age structure), which dominated the zooplankton of this lake, was analyzed in more detail. It was revealed that the hydrophysical and hydrochemical regimes of the lake in different years are subject to significant changes and are reflected in the indicators of zooplankton. Changes in the structure of zooplankton under the influence of natural factors are mainly due to the stimulating effect of an increase in water mineralization on the Artemia population and its depressing effect on the brackish fauna. With a decrease in water salinity less than 100 g/dm(3) since 2017 (127 g/m(3)) to 2021 (96 g/dm(3)) maximum (summer) Artemia biomass decreased from 167 to 17.7 g/m(3). At the same time, the maximum biomass of rotifers, cladocerans, and copepods increased from 0.003, 0, and 0.63 to 6.21, 1.35, and 2.65 g/m(3) respectively.

There is a paucity of information available for the freshwater form from Canadian waters. In the summer of 2003, we serendipitously collected 28 of the freshwater form of fourhorn sculpin from Lake Tuborg, Ellesmere Island, Nunavut. The fish ranged in size from 62 mm to 171 mm total length and age from 1 to 12 years with females growing faster and to a larger theoretical maximum total length than males. The sculpin preyed mainly upon the crustacean, Mysis segerstralei, but were also opportunistic feeders (e.g., Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) eggs) and cannibalistic. Although our sample of fourhorn sculpin is small, the data from these fish represent the only information from a fully freshwater form population of the species from Canadian waters. We also present an updated list of the known Canadian lacustrine and riverine populations of fourhorn sculpin.																			0004-0843	1923-1245				MAR	2023	76	1					72	82		10.14430/arctic77063	http://dx.doi.org/10.14430/arctic77063													WOS:000960441800007

Effectively targeting the highest loading sources are key. The Pareto principle (also known as the 80/20 rule) states that, for many events, roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes. This can be widely observed in the field of watershed management where a large proportion of non-point source pollution originates from one or few areas or sites. In this presentation we use Moody Lake as an example of the value of investing in pre-project diagnostic monitoring as well as post-project effectiveness monitoring to maximize cost-benefits of water quality improvement projects. Intensive monitoring of tributary streams revealed that implementation in one wetland complex within the watershed could achieve approximately 80% of the watershed phosphorus load reductions needed for Moody Lake to meet water quality standards (mean summer phosphorus concentration of 40 mu g/L), with a 25-year life cycle cost of just $38-53 per pound of phosphorus removed.																					978-0-7844-8143-1				2018							297	302																WOS:000437019800030

The impact of climate warming on water temperature, timing of hatching and young-of-the-year growth of fish in shallow lakes in the Netherlands	JOURNAL OF SEA RESEARCH					Niels Daan Symposium on Sustainable Management of Marine Living Resources	APR 19, 2007	Wageningen, NETHERLANDS					The Intergovernmental Panel oil Climate Change (IPCC) predicts increases in global average surface temperature from 1.1 to 6.4 degrees C for the year 2100. Here, we focus Oil the impact of climate warming on eutrophic shallow lakes in the Netherlands, using three representative lakes that cover the full range of lake sizes and depths. In these lakes, temperature has been shown to be the main determinant of hatching and growth of young-of-the-year fish. Because records of water temperature of our study lakes are incomplete, we applied an existing model to predict water temperatures from air temperatures for shallow, wind exposed and holomictic water bodies. To evaluate the implications of our results for marine systems, we also analyzed water temperature data of Marsdiep, a tidal inlet to the Waddensea. The lake water temperature model fitted equally well to all four water bodies. Applying the water temperature model to the period 1961-2006 showed all annual increase of 0.042 degrees C irrespective of lake size and depth. We extrapolated the consequences of lake warming for the onset of growth of larval bream and the size Of young-of-the-year bream at the end of the year Using an existing fish hatching and growth model. Both models were tested against data from Lake Tjeukemeer, which is intermediate in size compared to Lake Zwemlust and Lake IJsselmeer. The main conclusions of this study are that I) there is a very tight coupling between air and water temperatures in Dutch shallow lakes, irrespective of their size, resulting in highly similar patterns of lake temperature and a direct translation of climate warming into lake warming; 2) oil average water temperature has increased by 2 'C in the period 1961-2006; 3) temperature patterns in the tidal inlet showed a Surprising resemblance with the lake temperature patterns, the coastal marine system essentially behaving like an extremely large lake; 4) there are, however, strong seasonal patterns in the extent of warming in a given period of the year; 5) lake warming leads to ca. 3 weeks earlier onset of growth and 20 mill larger sizes in bream during 1971 -2006 under the assumption of temperature limited growth in these eutrophic ecosystems.

The dataset includes results on isotopic composition of 399 water samples, namely precipitation: event-based ( n = 108), cumulative monthly ( n = 22); surface water: lakes, reservoirs, brooks, rivers, channels ( n = 175), groundwater: shallow and artesian groundwater, spring ( n = 85), tapwater ( n = 9). For each sample name of the source, location, latitude, longitude and date of sampling, measurement uncertainty (one standard deviation) are available. The samples were assessed by plotting the data in dual 818 O vs. 82 H isotope space with reference to values found in the published literature and fitting a linear regression equation for Astana (event) precipitation. Overall, this is the first dataset covering wide range of sources across Kazakhstan, which could be used by global and regional water resource assessments and studies such as tracing water sources, hydrograph separation and end-member analyses, isotope mass balance, evapotranspiration partitioning, residence time analysis and groundwater recharge.

J	Trunk, L; Bernard, A				Trunk, Laura; Bernard, Alain			Investigating crater lake warming using ASTER thermal imagery: Case studies at Ruapehu, Poas, Kawah Ijen, and Copahue Volcanoes	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												A two-channel or split-window algorithm designed to correct for atmospheric conditions was applied to thermal images taken by the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) of Lake Yugama on Kusatsu-Shirane volcano in Japan in order to measure the temperature of its crater lake. These temperature calculations were validated using lake water temperatures that were collected on the ground. Overall, the agreement between the temperatures calculated using the split-window method and ground truth is quite good, typically +/- 1.5 degrees C for cloud-free images. Data from fieldwork undertaken in the summer of 2004 at Kusatsu-Shirane allow a comparison of ground-truth data with the radiant temperatures measured using ASTER imagery. Further images were analyzed of Ruapehu, Poas, Kawah Ijen, and Copahue volcanoes to acquire time-series of lake temperatures. A total of 64 images of these 4 volcanoes covering a wide range of geographical locations and climates were analyzed. Results of the split-window algorithm applied to ASTER images are reliable for monitoring thermal changes in active volcanic lakes. These temperature data, when considered in conjunction with traditional volcano monitoring techniques, lead to a better understanding of whether and how thermal changes in crater lakes aid in eruption forecasting.

Proxies include diatoms, ostracods, plants remains, organic matter content and sedimentological studies, and they suggest that Lake Arturo experienced climate-related variations in the water level, hydrological balance and temporal stability throughout the last 23,200 cal yr BP. The Late Glacial period, which ended about 15,400 cal yr BP, is characterized by a few low-diversity diatom assemblages dominated by benthic and small-celled fragilarioid taxa. Between the Pleistocene-Holocene transition and the mid-Holocene, Lake Arturo was a shallow, fresh-to-brackish lake with relatively high organic productivity. Around 6200 cal yr BP, the diatom Surirella tuberosa replaced Thalassiosira patagonica, and diatom species richness fell to its lowest level in the records. Together with the presence of the ostracod Limnocythere rionegroensis, which lives in ephemeral environments, this suggests that the lake was very shallow and experienced negative hydrological balance, with hydrochemical and biological conditions that were similar to those of today. Data from other sites in southern Tierra de Fuego suggest that, around 5000 cal yr BP until 800 cal yr BP the rainfall increased and the temperature decreased as a result of an intensification of the Southern Westerlies. By that time, the Lake Arturo record indicates the existence of an ephemeral, shallow, highly saline water body. This suggests an antiphase response to the atmospheric circulation pattern between the southern humid forest and the northern steppe during the middle to late Holocene.																			0031-0182	1872-616X				JUL 15	2020	550								109737	10.1016/j.palaeo.2020.109737	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2020.109737													WOS:000536187800009

The ecological environment of the Yangtze River Economic Belt must be protected not only for regional economic development but also for regional ecological security and ecological progress in this region. This paper takes the ecological space of the Yangtze River Economic Belt as the research object, based on land use data in 2010 and 2015, and uses the FLUS model to simulate and predict the ecological space of the research area in 2035. The variation of the research area's ecological space area and its four sub-zones has remarkable stability under diverse situations. Both the production space priority scenarios (S1) and living space priority scenarios (S2) saw a fall in ecological space area, with the former experiencing the highest reduction (a total reduction of 25,212 km(2)). Under the ecological space priority scenarios (S3) and comprehensive space optimization scenario (S4), the ecological space area increased, and the ecological space area expanded even more under the former scenario (a total growth of 23,648 km(2)). In Yunnan-Guizhou, the ecological space is relatively stable, with minimal signs of change. In Sichuan-Chongqing, the Sichuan Basin, Zoige Grassland, and Longmen Mountains were significant regions of area changes in ecological space. In the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, the ecological space changes mainly occur in the Wuyi Mountains, Mufu Mountains, and Dabie Mountains, as well as the surrounding waters of Dongting Lake. The Yangtze River Delta's changes were mainly observed in the eastern Dabie Mountains and Jianghuai Hills.																			1009-637X	1861-9568				FEB	2023	33	2			SI		373	391		10.1007/s11442-023-2087-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11442-023-2087-9													WOS:000936853400009

However, the moisture history of this region during the Holocene has been a controversial topic for several decades. Here, we performed optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating and grain-size analysis of aeolian sediments from the eastern Balikun Basin. Our results demonstrated that the early Holocene climate in the Balikun Basin was dry (before ~6.5 ka) and then became wetter during the mid-late Holocene. This Holocene climate pattern correlates well with other climatic inferences from various proxies acquired at various ACA locations, further supporting an earlier view that the Holocene climate in ACA was out of phase with that of the East Asia summer monsoon. Furthermore, an extremely dry event at 4.3-2.6 ka correlated well with pollen records and a decrease of ~4 degrees C in temperature in the western Balikun Lake, but this event was not evident in other ACA regions. Finally, Mingsha Shan Sand Dunes in the eastern Balikun Basin initially accumulated in the earliest Holocene. We suggest that the early Holocene dry climate in the ACA region and the local geomorphology are responsible for the formation of the Mingsha Shan Sand Dunes.

J	Külköylüoglu, O				Kulkoyluoglu, Okan			A new ostracod species of the genus Xestoleberis from Nansen Island, Wilhelmina Bay, Southern Ocean, Antarctica	POLAR BIOLOGY												Comparing to the ostracod studies on the other islands in the world, studies on the ostracod fauna of the islands in Antarctica are scarce. During the sixth Turkish Antarctica Expedition (TAE 6) to the islands (Dismal, Horseshoe, Nansen, Livingstone) in Western Antarctica, sediment and water samples were collected from 32 different water bodies (lakes, ponds, creeks, springs, littoral zones of sea). Among several new reports of different taxonomic groups which are under investigation, a new marine ostracod species (Xestoleberis nansenensis n. sp.) was encountered from Nansen Island. This is the first report of an ostracod from this island below 60 & DEG; S in Antarctica. The new species has several different features both in the carapace and soft body parts. Absence of ostracods from other islands sampled may be related to several a/biotic factors, such as water chemistry (e.g., relatively low calcium levels), extreme aquatic conditions (e.g., low-temperature values), improper habitat conditions (e.g., too little or absence of sediment in the water bodies), and isolation of the island(s) from the mainland. Although our new species is a marine form, comparative literature review indicated that there is no non-marine living ostracod species reported from the islands visited during the expedition. Possible reasons are discussed.					; KÜLKÖYLÜOĞLU, OKAN/A-6441-2018	KULKOYLUOGLU, OKAN/0000-0003-4712-5612; 													0722-4060	1432-2056				OCT	2023	46	10					1123	1136		10.1007/s00300-023-03189-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00300-023-03189-7		AUG 2023											WOS:001049905800001

Effect of deposition and erosion within the main river channel and large lakes on sediment delivery to the estuary of the Yangtze River	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE												[1] To examine the influence of deposition and erosion within the main river channel and large lakes on sediment delivery to the estuary at the mouth of the Yangtze River, we established sediment budgets from time series data for 1956 - 2004 of annual sediment load gauged at 24 stations and estimated data for ungauged areas. Ungauged areas supplied approximately 17% of the total sediment to the estuary, while an average of 34% of sediment is stored in the main river channel complex. Prior to the operation of the Three Gorges Dam (TGD) in 2003, 88% of deposition occurred within a 700-km section immediately downstream from the outlet of the Three Gorges area, including the main channel and a linked lake. Since the operation of the dam, however, deposition has migrated into the Three Gorges area, and downstream erosion has been observed. Patterns of deposition and erosion depend mainly on sediment input, except for the lower 500 km of the river where water discharge is the governing factor. Although sediment supply from the subbasins to the main river system will presumably experience a further decrease because of construction of new dams and afforestation, sediment flux to the estuary is unlikely to fall below 100 x 10(9) kg/yr over the next 50 years because sediment availability downstream of the TGD will not be a limiting factor over this timescale.

Climate research in the Nepal Himalaya	MOUNTAINS WITNESSES OF GLOBAL CHANGES: RESEARCH IN THE HIMALAYA AND KARAKORAM: SHARE-ASIA PROJECT	Developments in Earth Surface Processes											Nepal is a mountainous country with extreme topographical variation. This paper discusses some climatic research works in Nepal, mainly focusing on climate change and its impact, as well as the monsoon in Nepal. Studies have indicated increasing trends of maximum temperature in most parts of the country, with high warming trends in the Himalayan and middle mountain regions compared to lower altitudes and plains. This result is also supported by the retreating glacier trend in the Nepal Himalaya. Studies show that these glaciers are retreating at an alarming rate, with a potential negative impact on water resource management and threat of glacier lake outburst floods. General circulation models were used in 1994 and climate change scenarios were developed to study the impact of climate change on water resources and agriculture. The Department of Hydrology and Meteorology in Nepal has now started experiments on a high-resolution regional climate model, the RegCM3 to study the impact of climate change and to assess vulnerability. The role of the Himalaya on the Asian Summer Monsoon (ASM) has been well recognized in many modeling studies. In 1999, the Monsoon Himalayan Precipitation Experiment was carried out to study the interaction of the Himalaya and the ASM.

Pyrite occurs as ovules up to 2 cm in diameter within graphitic slates, and as fine disseminations in metagraywacke units. Scanning electron microscopy studies indicate the pyrite is framboidal in morphology. .delta.34S values of pyrite from the Deer Lake sediments range from -2.3 to 11.1.permill., with a peak at .apprx. + 2.permill.. Isotopic data are consistent with either high temperature inorganic reduction of circulating seawater sulfate, or low temperature bacterial reduction. The lack of sulfide bands or massive occurrences in the sediments, the restriction of pyrite mineralization to the sediments, and the absence of evidence for hot spring activity suggest that a diagenetic origin of pyrite is more feasible. Sulfide in such an environment would be produced principally by the action of sulfate-reducing bacteria. Results of the study are in agreement with those of Goodwin et al. (1976) who suggest that dissimilatory sulfate reduction was operative in the Archean ocean some 2.75 billion yr ago.																			0016-7037	1872-9533					1981	45	6					839	+		10.1016/0016-7037(81)90113-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0016-7037(81)90113-7													WOS:A1981LV06000006

Large ice-dammed lakes with reversed outlets, e.g. toward the Caspian Sea, formed south of these ice sheets. Some lakes are reconstructed from shorelines and lacustrine sediments, others mainly from ice-sheet configuration. Ice-dammed lakes, considerably larger than any lake on Earth today, are reconstructed for the periods 90-80 and 60-50 ka. The ages are based on numerous optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dates. During the global Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, about 20 ka) the Barents-Kara Ice Sheet was too small to block these eastern rivers, although in contrast to the 90-80 and 60-50 ka maxima, the Scandinavian Ice Sheet grew large enough to divert rivers and meltwater across the drainage divide from the Baltic Basin to the River Volga, and that way to the Caspian Sea. Climate modelling shows that the lakes caused lower summer temperatures on the continent and on the lower parts of the ice sheet. The final drainage of the best mapped lake is modelled, and it is concluded that it probably emptied within few months. We predict that this catastrophic outburst had considerable impact on sea-ice formation in the Arctic Ocean and on the climate of a much larger area. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Description, life cycle, and development of the myxozoan Myxobolus rasmusseni n. sp. in fathead minnows, Pimephales promelas : A possible emerging pathogen in southern Alberta, Canada	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PARASITOLOGY-PARASITES AND WILDLIFE												Morphological, gene sequence, host tissue tropism, and life cycle characteristics were utilized to describe the myxozoan, Myxobolus rasmusseni n. sp. from fathead minnow, Pimephales promelas, collected from reservoirs in southern Alberta. Results from serial histological sections of whole heads showed that myxospores were contained within irregular-shaped and sized coelozoic capsules (=plasmodia). Clusters of membrane-bound, myxospore-filled plasmodia filled the head cavities of juvenile fathead minnows, leading to the development of large, white, disfiguring lesions in mid to late summer. Bilateral exopthalmia (pop-eye disease) was a common outcome of M. rasmusseni n. sp. development. BLASTn search of a 1974 bp sequence of the 18S rDNA gene isolated from myxospores indicated that M. rasmusseni n. sp. was distinct from other coelozoic and histozoic Myxobolus spp. cataloged in GenBank. 18S rDNA gene sequences from triactinomyxon spores released from the oligochaete Tubifex were 100% identical to sequences from myxospores collected from syntopic fathead minnows. Results from a longitudinal survey of the 2020 cohort of fathead minnows showed that young-of-the-year are exposed at 1-5 mo and that 60-90% of these had developed myxospore-filled lesions approximately one year later. Data regarding potential sources and timing of M. rasmusseni n. sp. emergence in fathead minnow populations are needed.

Uptake experiments with fluorescently labelled bacteria (FLB) and picocyanobacteria (FLC) were performed in order to compare the importance of both prey types as carbon sources for bacterivorous protists. Heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNF) were responsible for similar to 90% of total protozoan picoplanktivory (FLB + FLC); ciliates accounted for similar to 10%. A selectivity index related to prey density showed that both HNF and ciliates clearly preferred FLC over FLB. The mean cell size of autotrophic (prokaryotic) picoplankton (APP) was nearly three times larger (0.323 mu m(3)) and much less variable than mean bacterial cell volume (0.122 mu m(3)). Although APP biomass was on average only 8.6% of total picoplankton biomass, picocyanobacteria accounted for a mean 15.9% of total HNF carbon uptake. We calculated that total HNF grazing could match potential APP maximum growth rates at the beginning of the study period. A strong decrease in HNF individual clearance rate (CR) on APP was clearly related to a fall in the percentage of choanoflagellates (from 75 to similar to 10% of the HNF community). A simultaneous decrease in HNF biomass and CR was followed by a steep increase in APP abundance; APP abundance and HNF biomass were highly negatively correlated both in the epi- and the metalimnion (rs(EPI) = -0.879, rs(META) -0.907; P < 0.001). Total rotifer abundance increased by a factor of 50 within 2 weeks and was also negatively correlated with HNF biomass (rs(EPI) = -0.852 P < 0.001; rs(META) = -0.659, P < 0.05). HNF grazing was found to exert a strong short-term control on picocyanobacteria and this link was probably broken by an increase in metazooplankton, especially due to rotifer predation on HNF.					; Pernthaler, Jakob/A-2257-2008; Šimek, Karel/AAB-1956-2021	Simek, Karel/0000-0002-7058-9063; Pernthaler, Jakob/0000-0001-7558-909X; 													0142-7873	1464-3774				MAR	1996	18	3					443	462		10.1093/plankt/18.3.443	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/18.3.443													WOS:A1996TZ27200009
J	Xiao, ZX; Duan, AM; Chen, YH; Wei, C; Luo, XL				Xiao, Zhixiang; Duan, Anmin; Chen, Yuhang; Wei, Chen; Luo, Xiaoli			Different mechanisms of Eurasian snow cover on precipitation during the early and late pre-rainy season in South China	SCIENCE CHINA-EARTH SCIENCES												The interannual variability in precipitation during the pre-rainy season (PRS) in South China is significantly correlated with Eurasian snow cover. This study elucidates the distinct mechanisms by which Eurasian snow cover anomalies in March influence precipitation during the early (pre-monsoon) and late (post-monsoon) PRS. In the early PRS, anomalous snow cover in the western region of Eastern Europe (WEE) triggers a southeastward-propagating wave train that impacts Central Asia. The teleconnection pattern induces anomalous cyclonic circulation in Central Asia, which reinforces the midlatitude zonal wind, contributing to the zonal wind wave train pattern towards East Asia. As a result, the East Asian subtropical westerly jet and the western North Pacific subtropical high are enhanced, and the related upper-level divergence, ascending motion, and moisture convergence in South China are intensified, collectively promoting precipitation there. In contrast, during the late PRS, increased snow cover across the eastern sector of Eastern Europe (EEE) and the region east of Lake Baikal (ELB) inhibit South China's precipitation. The wave pattern associated with the EEE (ELB) snow anomaly propagates southeastwards (southwards) to lower latitudes, intensifying the western North Pacific subtropical high. Furthermore, the perturbation stemming from the ELB region induces negative geopotential height anomalies aloft and amplifies the baroclinic anticyclone over the western Pacific. This resulted in prevailing subsidence over South China, which in turn suppresses precipitation during the late PRS. Numerical experiments corroborate the observed circulation adjustments and precipitation responses to snow cover anomalies in the two periods, lending credence to the proposed mechanisms.

Based on the Cs-137 and Pb-210 dating, multi-proxy records, enrichment factor (EF), and geoaccumulation index (I-geo) methods, the history of human-environment interactions in Xingyun lake catchment during the past 140years was studied. The results showed that the total heavy metal pollution in Xingyun lake followed the decreasing order: the northwestern>the middle>the southwestern>the southern>the north easterly. These distributions were controlled by regional geochemical background values, pollution load, and the lake current driven by prevailing southwesterly winds. The total EF value of heavy metals followed the decreasing order: EF (Zn)>EF (Cr)>EF (Pb)>EF (Cd)>EF (Cu). The total I-geo value of heavy metals also followed the decreasing order: I-geo (Zn)>I-geo (Cr)>I-geo (Pb)>I-geo (Cd)>I-geo (Cu). Consequently, the total pollution level of heavy metals followed the decreasing order: Zn>Cr>Pb>Cd>Cu. Before 1910AD, the natural erosion caused by climate changes was the key factor for the heavy metals accumulated. After 1910AD, the heavy metal concentrations were mainly controlled by anthropogenic impacts, the dominant sources were from industrial pollution, agricultural pollution, mining, and organic degradation. Finally, the sedimentary evolution history of Xingyun lake can be divided into four stages, i.e., (1) natural evolution stage during 1862-1910AD, (2) anthropogenic disturbance stage during 1910-1953AD, (3) anthropogenic reconstruction stage during 1953-1984AD, and (4) eutrophication stage after 1984AD.

Labeled images of emerged salmonids in a riverine environment	BMC RESEARCH NOTES												ObjectivesThese data enable the development of machine learned models to detect unintended passage of salmonids over in-stream barriers. Such models are key to fully characterizing the effectiveness of selective passage systems, as they detect and quantify fish passage which occurs outside of the intended transit passage and selection mechanism. These data were used to construct custom surveillance tools for FishPass (https://www.glfc.org/fishpass.php), a 20-year restoration project to provide selective up- and down-stream passage of desirable fishes while simultaneously blocking or removing undesirable fishes.Data descriptionThe datasets contain over 2300 annotated images of emerged salmonids collected in a natural riverine environment. The images stem from surveillance video collected during 2022 and 2023 fall runs of several pacific salmonid species introduced to the Laurentian Great Lakes on the Boardman (Ottaway) River in Traverse City, MI, USA. In addition to images of fully emerged salmonids, datasets are provided containing images of partially emerged salmonids, fully submerged fish, and other wildlife present in a riverine environment. The environmental conditions represented by most of the images were clear or partly cloudy. These datasets could be used to develop custom object detection models for emerged fish in riverine environments.

Pollen analysis was conducted for the first time on a 200-m long core of Quaternary lacustrine sediments taken from the main body of the TP in order to study pollen assemblages as well as vegetation and climate changes of glacial (cold)/interglacial (warm) periods. Pollen analysis of alpine snow and ice began at the first scientific expedition to the TP in the 1970s. After the 1980s, a series of international collaborative programs were carried out under Sino-French, Sino-German, Sino-Australian, and Sino-American cooperation, marking the integration of Chinese Quaternary palynology society with the international community. New methods for Quaternary palynology were gradually promoted and applied, changing the vegetational and climatic interpretation of Quaternary palynology from qualitative to quantitative. Since the 1990s, many palynologists have carried out extensive Quaternary palynological studies on fossil pollen sites of more than 60 lakes/sections and alpine glaciers in the TP to discuss the spatiotemporal vegetation changes and climatic and environmental evolution of the TP since the Pleistocene. Over the past half-century, Quaternary palynology in the TP has contributed to the establishment of the Chinese Quaternary pollen database and the study of vegetation and climate evolution since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) in the TP. Currently available pollen records revealed the spatial and temporal distribution of vegetation in the TP since the LGM, exhibiting expansions and shrinkages of forest, meadow, grassland and desert in different periods such as the LGM, the last deglaciation, and Holocene optimum period. The paleomonsoon reflected by paleovegetation since the LGM has undergone the changes of weak-strengthening-strong-weakening but still active-shrinking, which is mainly affected by solar insolation.

Research was undertaken to investigate the epidemiology of the disease in preparation for a control program. The interplay of 3 factors (age, sex and ethnic affiliation) largely defined the demographic patterns of the prevalence and the intensity of infection. Both of these increased in young children up to a peak at age 10-14 yr, and then declined, the intensity of infection more rapidly than the prevalence. The prevalence and intensity of infection were both greater in males than females (above ages 15-24 yr and 5-9 yr, respectively), and differences between the 2 main ethnic groups were related to differences in their lake-related activities. Differences between the patterns of prevalence and intensity of infection are attributed to the greater sensitivity of the latter measurement in indicating changes in the level of transmission. Practical difficulties were encountered in obtaining a precise measurement of incidence, the most important being the considerable degree of population movement. A field cohort study showed a seasonality of transmission, greatest between Jan. and April, during the period of high level of the lake and in the early part of the draw-down. Research on the intermediate snail host (Bulinus truncatus rohlfsi) and lakeside ecology established the focality of transmission at human water-contact sites serving the shore-line communities and, in conjunction with parasitological surveys, its seasonality: variations in ecology that accompanied the annual rise and fall of the lake led to high levels of transmission when the water level was high and lower levels during the draw-down. The geographical distribution of the infection was also affected by differences in ecology, specifically by variations in the distribution and abundance of the aquatic weed Ceratophyllum demersum. A non-seasonal decline in transmission observed in 1 locality during the period from 1973-1975 resulted from a local decrease in the amount of Ceratophyllum.																			0042-9686	1564-0604					1982	60	1					89	100											6979420					WOS:A1982NP02400010
J	Rohrlack, T				Rohrlack, Thomas			The diel vertical migration of the nuisance alga Gonyostomum semen is controlled by temperature and by a circadian clock	LIMNOLOGICA												Gonyostomum semen is a bloom-forming freshwater raphidophyte that is currently on the increase, which concerns stakeholders and ecologists alike. Much indicates that the success of G. semen is linked to its diel vertical migration (DVM). The DVM was therefore studied in its natural setting using environmental sensors with data logging. DVM happened partly in the absence of light detectable by sensors, suggesting that the DVM involved gravitaxis, although an involvement of phototaxis could not be fully excluded. G. semen migrated downwards the earlier the warmer the water was. The upwards migration showed features of endogenous rhythms, implying that the temporal control of the DVM also has a circadian component that ensures synchronization with the day-night cycle. It is hypothesized that by causing an early descent, exposure to warm water may give G. semen more time to exploit the nutrient-rich lower part of the water column before the circadian control initiates upwards migration. The warming of lakes, caused by global warming or by the more effective conversion of light energy into heat due to the brownification of lakes, may therefore be of advantage to G. semen. In addition, the steep temperature gradient, which is typical for humic lakes during summer stratification, may help avoid the desynchronizing effect that turbulence can have on gravitactic DVMs. Above features of the DVM of G. semen therefore provide putative explanations for why the alga is particularly successful in humic lakes and why it profits from lake brownification and global warming.																			0075-9511	1873-5851				JAN	2020	80								125746	10.1016/j.limno.2019.125746	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.limno.2019.125746													WOS:000507369400010
J	Lozhkin, AV; Anderson, P; Eisner, WR; Solomatkina, TB				Lozhkin, Anatoly V.; Anderson, Patricia; Eisner, Wendy R.; Solomatkina, Tatiana B.			Late glacial and holocene landscapes of central Beringia	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												New palynological and sedimentological data from St. Lawrence Island present a rare view into late-glacial and Holocene environments of the central Bering Land Bridge. The late glaciation was a time of dynamic landscape changes in south-central Beringia, with active thermokarst processes, including the formation and drainage of thaw lakes. The presence of such a wet, unstable substrate, if widespread, probably would have had an adverse impact on food sources and mobility for many of the large mammal populations. The establishment of Betula shrub tundra on the island suggests late-glacial summers that were warmer than present, consistent with regional paleoclimatic interpretations. However, the increasing proximity to the Bering Sea, as postglacial sea levels rose, modified the intensity of warming and prevented the establishment of deciduous forest as found in other areas of Beringia at this time. The mid- to late Holocene is marked by more stable land surfaces and development of Sphagnum and Cyperaceae peat deposits. The accumulation of organic deposits, decline of shrub Betula, and decrease in thermokarst disturbance suggest that conditions were cooler than the previous.

J	Taylor, AH; Trouet, V; Skinner, CN				Taylor, A. H.; Trouet, V.; Skinner, C. N.			Climatic influences on fire regimes in montane forests of the southern Cascades, California, USA	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE												The relationship between climate variability and fire extent was examined in montane and upper montane forests in the southern Cascades. Fire occurrence and extent were reconstructed for seven sites and related to measures of reconstructed climate for the period 1700 to 1900. The climate variables included the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), summer temperature (TEMP), NINO3, a measure of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). Fire extent at the site and regional scale was associated with dry and warm conditions in the year of the fire and regional fire extent was not associated with ENSO or PDO for the full period of analysis. The relationship between regional fire extent and climate was not stable over time. The associations of fire extent with PDSI and TEMP were only significant from similar to 1775 onward and the associations were strongest between 1805 and 1855. PDO and fire extent were also associated during the 1805-1855 period, and ENSO was associated with fire extent before 1800, but not after. The interannual and interdecadal variability of the fire response to temperature and drought suggests that increased periods of regional fire activity may occur when high interannual PDSI variation coincides with warm decades.					; Trouet, Valerie/AAE-4888-2021	Trouet, Valerie/0000-0002-2683-8704; 													1049-8001	1448-5516					2008	17	1					60	71		10.1071/WF07033	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/WF07033													WOS:000253219200007
J	ROOM, PM; THOMAS, PA				ROOM, PM; THOMAS, PA			NITROGEN, PHOSPHORUS AND POTASSIUM IN SALVINIA-MOLESTA MITCHELL IN THE FIELD - EFFECTS OF WEATHER, INSECT DAMAGE, FERTILIZERS AND AGE	AQUATIC BOTANY												More than 1700 samples of Salvinia molesta Mitchell were collected from sites distributed from close to the equator in Papua New Guinea to 33.degree. S in Australia. Nitrogen content ranged from 0.62 to 4.0% dry weight, phosphorus from 0.03 to 1.07% and potassium from 0.31 to 5.32%. Tops contained more concentrated N and P than roots, while K was more concentrated in roots. Concentrations of N and P were significantly correlated. Rainfall, followed by runoff, resulted in peaks of N, P and K in plants in one lake, but the sequence could not be demonstrated at other sites. At sites experiencing marked seasonal changes in temperature, N and P contents were inversely correlated with temperature, probably due to greater growth and utilisation of nutrients in summer. Damage caused by the biological control agent Cyrtobagous salviniae Calder and Sands decreased K content, while N and P contents were increased in some cases, but not in others. Thick mats of S. molesta in Papua New Guinea contained less concentrated N and P than thin mats, but this was not necessarily the case in the Australian sites. The reasons for these differences, and the likely effects on biological control agents, are discussed. Urea and superphosphate were found to increase N and P concentrations in the plant by amounts useful for experimental purposes and for aiding establishment of biological control agents. An equation related N concentration to the amount of urea applied and background N content of the plant. Concentrations of N, P and K decreased with age. Levels of N and P dropped most quickly as buds opened, then dropped slowly until the onset of senescence caused another rapid decline. The implications of these changes for insects feeding on S. molesta are discussed.																			0304-3770	1879-1522				JUN	1986	24	3					213	232		10.1016/0304-3770(86)90058-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-3770(86)90058-6													WOS:A1986D255200001

We employ three classes of sedimentary remains (mandibles of larval Chaoborus, diatom valves and chrysophyte scales) to verify that the fish communities of three small, acidic (pH 5.3-5.6) Canadian Shield lakes in south-central Ontario were richer 20-100 years ago at a time when the lakes were almost certainly less acidic. To do this, we first verify that Chaoborus americanus is never abundant in the presence of fish using data from a new survey of 50 lakes that corrects for methodological flaws of the past. We then examine changes with sediment depth in our three classes of indicators in Lakes Drummer, Little Eastend, and Shoelace. In all cases, appearances of Chaoborus americanus and changes among algal remains in recent sediments suggest that fish were lost at a time when lake waters were acidifying, particularly because of pH depressions during spring melt. These results contribute to a growing body of literature indicating that the use of multiple sedimentary indicators can provide assessments of past limnological conditions that are of interest to both lake managers and aquatic ecologists. They also suggest that the fish communities of some small, currently acidic lakes in south-central Ontario were almost certainly richer in the past.					; Yan, Norman/H-5235-2013; Smol, John/A-8838-2015	Smol, John/0000-0002-2499-6696; Yan, Norman/0000-0003-4870-6865; 													0165-7836					FEB	1994	19	1-2					157	177		10.1016/0165-7836(94)90021-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0165-7836(94)90021-3													WOS:A1994MY25200011

A series of restoration measures have been implemented since 2009 in northern Lake Gehu. This study compared aquatic plants, water quality, sediment, and phytoplankton between restoration and control areas to investigate the effect of restoration measures. The results demonstrated that aquatic macrophyte coverage increased from 0% to 10.6%; mean TP, TN, and CODMn concentrations increased by 50.0%, 42.4%, and 40.8%, respectively, compared with those before the measures were carried out; the mean Secchi depth (SD) increased to 42.5 cm, which is 1.4 times higher than that before restoration; the mean euphotic depth (Z(eu)) in the summer increased from 91 to 130 cm; the mean chl a concentration decreased from 34.8 to 20.2 mu g/L, compared with that before restoration; the Shannon-Wiener index of phytoplankton increased by 28.7%. The mean TP and TN concentrations in sediments decreased by 63.8% and 52.4%, respectively, compared with that before dredging. These results indicate that the restoration in northern Lake Gehu was effective. To complete the transformation from an algae- to a macrophyte-stable state within the region, further measures must be adopted. This restoration of a eutrophic lake can serve as a reference for similar eutrophic lakes.					he, shangwei/JTV-6737-2023; Wu, Xiaodong/ITT-3925-2023	Wu, Xiaodong/0000-0002-7218-4123													0254-4059	1993-5005				NOV	2017	35	6					1417	1431		10.1007/s00343-017-6107-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00343-017-6107-4													WOS:000415810900013

The isolates fell into two groups that were substantially different in terms of cell morphology, growth parameters and the ability to oxidize carbon disulfide. The bacteria were able to oxidize sulfide, polysulfide, sulfur and tetrathionate, as well as thiocyanate. Two isolates belonged to an extremely halotolerant type growing in the presence of up to 4 M Na+. Cyanate (CNO-) was the main nitrogen-containing intermediate during thiocyanate degradation in both groups. According to DNA-DNA hybridization data and phylogenetic analysis, both groups of isolates belong to a recently described genus of haloalkaliphillic sulfur-oxidizing bacteria, i.e. Thioalkalivibrio, belonging to the gamma-Proteobacteria, in which where they represent two new species. The species name Thioalkalivibrio paradoxus (type strain ARh 1(T) = DSM 13531(T) = JCM 11367(T)) is proposed for the group with barrel-shaped cells, and the species name Thioalkalivibrio thiocyanoxidans (type strain ARh 2(T), DSM 13532(T) = JCM 11368(T)) is proposed for the group with vibrio-shaped cells. The diagnosis of the genus Thioalkalivibrio is amended according to the new data.

This research was conducted at Oxbow Lake of Buluh Cina Village and the Ecology Laboratory of the Faculty of Fisheries and Marine Sciences, University of Riau. Sampling collection of O. hypophthalmus was carried out at Oxbow Lake (Pinang Dalam and Pinang Luar Lakes) of Buluh Cina from September to November 2016. Meanwhile, measurement of in situ water quality and data retrieval was carried out only on September 14, 2016. O. hypophthalmus is estimated to experience spawning only once a year. Spawning time or spawning of fish in November in 2016 was estimated to be exactly the time after the full moon in November before December. Glass catfish studied was not related to the rainy season which usually occurs in the same fish in the Kampar river, because that year coincided with the summer in those months. In recent years, there has been a lot of talk about global climate change which causes uncertain environmental and seasonal conditions. Erratic seasonal conditions have caused the rainy and dry seasons to be erratic. Every living creature, including fish, is strongly influenced by its environmental parameters, whether in the form of the season or the environmental conditions of its own environmental parameters. Although this research was only carried out in a short period of time, it was necessary to look at the influence of the environment on fish that was focused on glass catfish (O. hypophthalmus) at Oxbow Lake of Buluh Cina Kampar Protected Forest.					; Nofrizal, Nofrizal/GPK-4661-2022; Putra, Ridwan Manda/GON-7048-2022; Karnila, Rahman/GPP-3635-2022	Nofrizal, Nofrizal/0000-0002-9623-1684; Karnila, Rahman/0000-0003-4559-4423; Thamrin, Thamrin/0000-0003-3218-7546; Putra, Ridwan Manda/0009-0002-9742-6034														2318-1265				APR	2020	8	2					95	103		10.31893/jabb.20013	http://dx.doi.org/10.31893/jabb.20013													WOS:000528224700003
J	Aasetre, J; Bele, B				Aasetre, Jorund; Bele, Bolette			History of forestry in a central Norwegian boreal forest landscape: Examples from Nordli, Nord-TrOndelag	NORSK GEOGRAFISK TIDSSKRIFT-NORWEGIAN JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHY												Analysing forest history is crucial to understanding how shifting harvesting methods have different effects on forest landscape structure. Two main harvesting regimes in a Norwegian boreal forest landscape over a period of 150 years were detected by the study. A homogeneous impact regime resulting from selective logging changed the forest structure by logging the oldest and largest trees evenly throughout the forest, resulting in a homogeneous landscape structure. However, population growth in the 19th century led to a substantial increase in traditional subsistence forestry to obtain building materials, firewood, etc. The most intensive stage of this regime started in c.1860 when farmers began selling logging contracts to companies and timber traders. Despite this being termed a homogeneous landscape impact, the actual exploitation of the forest was strongly influenced by local factors such as the location of farms, summer farms, lakes, and rivers. Clear-cutting from the 1950s has resulted in a new heterogeneous impact regime, giving a landscape structure dominated by patches of even-aged stands. This regime still predominates. The analysis is based on a study of Nordli and the SandOla drainage basin in Nord-TrOndelag. Such studies should give a better understanding of the interaction between natural ecological conditions in and human impact on boreal forest landscapes.

Molecular Analysis of the Microbial Communities of Mars Analog Lakes in Western Australia	ASTROBIOLOGY												Unique, shallow interdune lakes and groundwaters with extremely low pH and high salinity exist in Australia, along with nearby lakes that possess higher pH values. These acidic hypersaline environments are possibly the best modern terrestrial analogues for past martian environments. However, no previous microbiological analyses of these lakes have been conducted. During the Australian winter of 2005, water samples were taken from several hypersaline lakes located in southern Western Australia that possessed acidic to slightly alkaline pH. These samples were subjected to molecular analysis to identify bacterial communities. DNA extraction and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the 16S rRNA gene sequences, by using universal bacterial primers, were also performed on the samples. Extracted DNA was amplified with 1070 forward and 1392 GC-clamped reverse primers and analyzed by using denaturant gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). In addition, libraries were developed from DNA retrieved from four lakes, including a marginal marine neutral lake, an inland neutral lake, and two inland acid lakes, and selected clones with distinct operational taxonomic units were sequenced. The DGGE profiles and clone sequence data indicate that there are distinct, abundant, and diverse microbial populations in these Australian hypersaline environments, especially the acidic ones. These results are significant for two reasons: (1) they provide the first microbiological survey of natural acid saline lakes and (2) they hint at the possibility that there could have been a diverse microbial population in acidic hypersaline environments on Mars.					; Hong, Bo-young/AAQ-1679-2021	Hong, Bo-Young/0000-0001-5055-0893; Mormile, Melanie/0000-0001-9054-2687; 													1531-1074	1557-8070				DEC	2009	9	10					919	930		10.1089/ast.2008.0293	http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/ast.2008.0293								20041745					WOS:000273181200001

At that time, the central Mediterranean was undergoing strong tectonic activity due to the rollback of the Adria slab and eastward migration of the Apenninic belt. The combined effects of the post-evaporitic MSC sea-level drop and morphostructural changes (due to the Intra-Messinian phase) resulted in a regional unconformity, which shows erosive markers and conformable relationships with the Messinian and Mio-Pliocene boundary in the Po Plain and Northern Adriatic Foreland. Here, we produce a palaeotopographic reconstruction of the Po Plain-Northern Adriatic region (PPNA) during the Messinian peak desiccation event based on such regional unconformity. We mapped this surface through wells and 2D seismic data form Eni's private dataset. The unconformity shows V-shaped incisions matching the present-day southern Alpine valleys and filled with Messinian post-evaporitic and Pliocene deposits, suggesting that the modern drainage network is at least of late Messinian age. The Messinian unconformity has been restored to its original state through flexural-backstripping numerical modelling. The resulting landscape suggests a maximum sea-level drop of 800-900 m during the MSC peak, and is consistent with stratigraphic and sedimentologic data provided by previous works. The modelled shoreline separates the subaerially eroded land from an elongated basin composed by two ca. 400 and 1,000 m deep depocentres during the maximum sea-level drop. These results suggest that the Mediterranean was split in at least three sub-basins subject to independent base levels, fresh-water budgets, and flexural responses during the maximum lowstand.

Population Characteristics of Yellow Perch in a Central Appalachia Hydropower Reservoir	JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Estimates of population characteristics of sport fishes inform fisheries management decisions and provide feedback on management strategies. Cheat Lake provides an unusual fishery in West Virginia because the hydropower reservoir supports a Yellow Perch Perca flavescens population. We estimated age structure, size structure, condition, total instantaneous mortality, growth, and summer diet for Cheat Lake Yellow Perch based on electrofishing collections in 2012. From 302 individuals, we observed a maximum age of 9 y. Maximum age, average size, and growth of females in the sample exceeded those of males. Cheat Lake Yellow Perch scored low on the relative weight index, but generally exhibited faster growth than other populations, even when compared by sex. Estimated annual survival was 0.63 (95% CI = 0.51-0.78), which is comparable to other exploited populations. These data support the presence of an ontogenetic diet shift from consumption of zooplankton to macroinvertebrates and fishes as Yellow Perch age. This study is the first evaluation we are aware of on Yellow Perch population characteristics in West Virginia, providing baseline data to enhance management decisions and direct future studies.

Intact cores were incubated in the laboratory and manipulated to simulate water-column anoxia during stratification and oxygenation during turnover. Reactions with S dominated Alk budgets in Mares Pond, whereas in Gull Pond reactions with N contributed most to Alk change. In Mares Pond, control cores held anoxically produced Alk at an average rate of 2.66 +/- 0.59 (SE, N = 3) meq m-2 d-1, mostly due to SO4(2-) reduction. This rate was similar to calculations from hypolimnetic monitoring in the pond during summer stratification. In cores from Mares Pond where the water column was aerated to simulate turnover, the reoxidation of S (1.3 meq SO4(2-) m-2 d-1) contributed most to consumption of Alk (3.5 meq m-2 d-1); half of all Alk lost during the 40-d experiment was consumed in the first 4 d of turnover. In aerated cores from Gull Pond, Alk consumption (4.2 meq m-2 d-1) was driven mostly by nitrification (2.8 meq m-2 d-1). High rates of Alk consumption observed in oxidized cores illustrate the potential for rapid Alk loss during seasonal turnover. Pore-water profiles of SO4(2-) and Alk suggest that sulfide oxidation was strongest in the top 1 cm of sediment and reached to a depth of 3-4 cm. Oxidation occurred rapidly in response to turnover, and although H2S may have been oxidized initially, the oxidation of solid-phase species dominated after 1 or 2 d. An isotopic mass balance of S in two turnover cores showed that from 30 to 70% of the oxidized S originated as inorganic rather than organic S.

The paleoenvironmental interpretation of the stratigraphic profiles was carried out based on the analysis of facies and their associations. The oldest age was recorded at 301 masl (27 ka) and the youngest corresponds to 266 masl (2.4 ka). The record of 27 ka was compared with another dated record of the Tar-San Martin Lakes basin showing that Viedma - Tar-San Martin Lakes were formed at similar ages. Taking into account that the deposits of Bahia Tunel are located at 266 masl and that the level of the lake would be above this height, it is proposed that this lake level would have restricted the movement of hunter-gatherer populations along the coast and to the west. From 2.4 ka on a new space started to be available for these populations broadening the wintering grounds (<= 400 masl). The chronology of the archaeological record found in this new space fits the proposed paleogeographic evolution. This paper complements the research on the evolution of lacustrine systems in the Patagonian Mountain range and broadens the discussion of human mobility in the Viedma Lake basin during the Holocene.

CURRENTS AND HEAT FLUXES INDUCE STRATIFICATION LEADING TO HYPOXIA IN GREEN BAY, LAKE MICHIGAN	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 36TH IAHR WORLD CONGRESS: DELTAS OF THE FUTURE AND WHAT HAPPENS UPSTREAM					36th IAHR World Congress	JUN 28-JUL 03, 2015	Delft, NETHERLANDS	Int Assoc Hydro Environm Engn & Res, Boskalis, Van Oord, UNESCO IHE, Delft Univ Technol, Deltares, Minist Infrastructure & Environm, Rijkswaterstaat, Royal HaskoningDHV, ARCADIS, WItteveen Bos, AANDERAA, Prince Sultan Bin Abulaziz Int Prize Water				Summer bottom water hypoxia has been a persisting water quality issue for decades in Green Bay, Lake Michigan's largest embayment. The nutrient loading of the bay has been fairly constant, yet the magnitude and duration of hypoxia is highly variable from year to year. The bay's morphology (similar to 22km x 190 km) with high riverine inflow and restricted mixing at the southern end of the bay, combined with large water mass exchange with Lake Michigan at the northern end of the bay, causes changes in the hydrodynamic structure play and sets up water column stratification that leads to hypoxic conditions. The onset of hypoxia is related to thermal stratification, which results from both direct meteorological forcing, i.e. low winds, high air temperatures, and increased solar radiation, and from indirect meteorological forcing that drives circulation patterns resulting in the southerly incursion of cooler bottom waters onto highly reducing organic rich sediments. This circulation pattern can stratify a well mixed water column within hours, and can set up stable stratification that persist for days to weeks during which time sediment oxygen demand rates are sufficient to deplete hypolimnetic oxygen. Therefore the morphometry, circulation patterns, and the thermal input-output balance of the bay interact to produce conditions that lead to variations in the degree, extent and duration of hypoxia. Previous field measurements showed that it is common for two layers to flow through the mouth of the bay in opposite directions during the stratified season. A 3D hydrodynamic model developed in this study, supported by existing and new field measurements, demonstrates the onset of stratification by the combined effect of surface heat flux and near bottom cold water transported southerly from Lake Michigan.

J	Manville, V; Hodgson, KA; White, JDL				Manville, V; Hodgson, KA; White, JDL			Rheological properties of a remobilised-tephra lahar associated with the 1995 eruptions of Ruapehu volcano, New Zealand	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF GEOLOGY AND GEOPHYSICS												Volcanic activity at Ruapehu during 1995/96 represents the most voluminous volcanic activity in New Zealand this century. Early in the eruption sequence, lahars were generated by the ejection of water, lake sediments, and pyroclastic material from the summit Crater Lake. Lahars (volcanic debris flows) generated by the remobilisation of pyroclastic fall deposits on the upper slopes of the volcano followed the two largest tephra-producing eruptions in October 1995, representing a previously unrecognised hazard. Prediction and mitigation of such hazards requires quantitative knowledge of initiation processes, lahar mechanics (i.e., rheology), and appropriate hydrodynamic routing for channelised flows. The rheological properties of a remobilised tephra lahar in the Mangatoetoenui valley were estimated using techniques developed for determining the properties of debris flows based on the geometry of their deposits. Calculated maximum flow velocities of 12-27 m/s, volumetric now rates of 1300-2000 m(3)/s, shear strengths of 1.9-3.4 x 10(3) Pa, and plastic viscosities of 29-93 Pa.s compare well with measured and estimated examples cited in the literature, and may aid in understanding and constraining this new class of hazard at Ruapehu volcano.

Watershed Suspended Sediment Supply and Potential Impacts of Dam Removals for an Estuary	ESTUARIES AND COASTS												Observations and modeling are used to assess potential impacts of sediment releases due to dam removals on the Hudson River estuary. Watershed sediment loads are calculated based on sediment-discharge rating curves for gauges covering 80% of the watershed area. The annual average sediment load to the estuary is 1.2 Mt, of which about 0.6 Mt comes from side tributaries. Sediment yield varies inversely with watershed area, with regional trends that are consistent with substrate erodibility. Geophysical and sedimentological surveys in seven subwatersheds of the Lower Hudson were conducted to estimate the mass and composition of sediment trapped behind dams. Impoundments were classified as (1) active sediment traps, (2) run-of-river sites not actively trapping sediment, and (3) dammed natural lakes and spring-fed ponds. Based on this categorization and impoundment attributes from a dam inventory database, the total mass of impounded sediment in the Lower Hudson watershed is estimated as 4.9 +/- 1.9 Mt. This represents about 4 years of annual watershed supply, which is small compared with some individual dam removals and is not practically available given current dam removal rates. More than half of dams impound drainage areas less than 1 km(2), and play little role in downstream sediment supply. In modeling of a simulated dam removal, suspended sediment in the estuary increases modestly near the source during discharge events, but otherwise effects on suspended sediment are minimal. Fine-grained sediment deposits broadly along the estuary and coarser sediment deposits near the source, with transport distance inversely related to settling velocity.

J	Smar, CM; Chambers, RM				Smar, CM; Chambers, RM			Homing behavior of Musk Turtles in a Virginia lake	SOUTHEASTERN NATURALIST												For nine weeks during the summer of 2002, a mark and recapture technique was used to study homing behavior of Musk Turtles (Sternotherus odoratus) living in Lake Matoaka, VA. During the first three weeks of the study, 119 turtles (83 male, 36 female) were captured using unbaited crabpots, then marked and displaced from the site of capture. Turtles were displaced 100 m across open water 4 m deep, 520 m along the same shore, or 550 m across open water. For the last six weeks of the study, 110 turtles (65 males, 45 females) were captured and released with no displacement. Overall, 39% (49/126) of males and 21% (15/71) of females in this study were captured more than once. Seventy-five of 118 recaptures (64%) were at the site of most recent release (sedentary behavior) and 11 recaptures (9%) were at neither the original nor most recent site of capture (non-homing behavior). Thirty-four of 118 recaptures of displaced turtles (29%) occurred at the site of original capture, and 31 (91%) of these movements were made by males, a significant difference in homing behavior between males and females during the time of the study. Neither distance nor open water significantly impeded turtle homing.																			1528-7092	1938-5412					2005	4	3					527	532		10.1656/1528-7092(2005)004[0527:HBOMTI]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1656/1528-7092(2005)004[0527:HBOMTI]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000232463000014

Hydrogeological controls on heterogeneous groundwater discharge to a large glacial lake	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Lacustrine groundwater discharge (LGD) can be an important pathway for delivering pollutants to large lakes but this pathway is often neglected. This is in part because characterizing the magnitude and spatial variability of LGD to large lakes is highly resource intensive. To better target efforts, particularly in glacial environments where the hydrogeology is often highly complex, there is a need to understand linkages between spatial LGD patterns and hydrogeological features. The objective of this study was to evaluate the magnitude and spatial variability of nearshore LGD to Lake Simcoe (area = 722 km(2)) and use this information to explore hydrogeological controls on the observed spatial LGD patterns. LGD was quantified by applying a steady state mass balance model to radon-222 ( Rn-222) data obtained from boat surveys conducted along similar to 80% of the lake's shoreline. Overall, LGD was highly spatially variable with total LGD to Lake Simcoe estimated to range from 7 +/- 1% to 16 +/- 2%, respectively, of the total volume of tributary inputs during summer. No large regional scale differences in LGD were found despite the diverse hydrogeological conditions around the lake. Rather, discrete shoreline areas with high LGD were observed around the lake. Areas with high LGD were related to permeable nearshore surficial sediments and tunnel channel aquifers which provide connectivity between large recharge features (moraines), regional aquifer units, and the lake. The study findings are needed to inform ctions aimed at managing non-point pollution sources to large glacial lakes including LGD. (C) 2020 International Association for Great Lakes Research.

Uranium bearing dissolved organic matter in the porewaters of uranium contaminated lake sediments	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												Uranium (U) mobility in the environment strongly depends on its oxidation state and the presence of complexing agents such as inorganic carbon, phosphates, and dissolved organic matter (DOM). Despite the importance of DOM in U mobility, the exact mechanism is still poorly understood. Therefore, the aim of our investigation was to characterise sediment porewater DOM in two lakes in Ontario, Canada (Bow and Bentley Lakes) that were historically contaminated with U and propose possible composition of UO2-bearing DOM. Depth profiles of U concentrations in porewaters and total sediment digests reveal U levels of up to 1.3 mg L-1 in porewater and up to 0.8 mg(-1) g in sediment. Depth profiles of U did not correlate with Fe, Mn, SO42-, or Eh profiles. Therefore, porewater DOM was analysed and taken into consideration as the primary source of U mobility. Porewater DOM in each sediment section (1 cm sections, 20 cm core length) was analysed by high-resolution electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry. PCA analyses of porewater DOM mass spectra showed grouping and clear separation of DOM in sediment sections with elevated U concentrations in comparison to sections with background U concentrations. Several criteria were set to characterise UO2-bearing DOM and more than 70 different molecules were found. The vast majority of these UO2-DOM compounds fell in the category of carboxyl-containing aliphatic molecules (H/C between 0.85 and 1.2 and O/C <= 0.4) and had a mean value of m/z about 720.																			0883-2927	1872-9134				APR	2018	91						36	44		10.1016/j.apgeochem.2018.01.009	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeochem.2018.01.009													WOS:000439018100004

For six basins in the area, detailed geomorphological maps were compiled, based on extensive field studies and remote sensing datasets. Several phases of high and low lake levels were reconstructed and dated by radiocarbon and optically stimulated luminescence. During the marine isotope stage (MIS) 6 lakes in southern and western Mongolia mostly disappeared. In contrast, large paleolakes existed during the last interglacial (MIS 5e) and lasted probably until the beginning of the last glacial. These huge lakes were caused by a strong East Asian summer monsoon, which reached southern and even western Mongolia. During the MIS 3 the monsoon was considerably weaker and most of the lakes were relatively small or even disappeared. Higher lake levels of this period were only recorded at the Orog Nuur. However, at this time the lake was fed by glacial melt water from the Khangai Mountains. The MIS 2 was again a very dry period. The previously supposed phase of synchronous high lake levels and glaciations in southern and western Mongolia is not supported by the data presented here. During the Holocene, lakes in the western and southern part of the study area evolved differently. Early Holocene high lake levels were reconstructed for the western lakes, while most of the southern lakes had highest lake levels in the mid Holocene. These differences can be attributed to different moisture bearing atmospheric systems. In the late Holocene lake levels were generally low and in the last 50 years most lakes completely disappeared due to a strong human usage of the water resources. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Correlation between the mass concentrations of suspended particles PM10 and PM2.5 and aerosol optical depth in the coastal zone of Lake Baikal	27TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEAN OPTICS, ATMOSPHERIC PHYSICS	Proceedings of SPIE				27th International Symposium on Atmospheric and Ocean Optics, Atmospheric Physics	JUL 05-09, 2021	Moscow, RUSSIA	Russian Acad Sci, Siberian Branch, V E Zuev Inst Atmospher Opt, Russian Acad Sci, A M Obukhov Inst Atmospher Phys, Russian Acad Sci, M A Sadovsky Inst Geosphere Dynam, Russian Acad Sci, Siberian Branch, Inst Solar Terrestrial Phys, Russian Acad Sci, Siberian Branch, V M Matrosov Inst Syst Dynam & Control Theory, MDPI, Atmosphere Open Access Journal, Solar Laser System, Photon Journal				The paper presents the results of measurements of aerosol optical depth (AOD) and mass concentration of fine aerosols PM2.5 and PM10 in the coastal zone of Lake Baikal during summer of 2020. During period of high aerosol turbidity of the atmosphere, a relationship was revealed between variations in the spectral characteristics of the aerosol optical depth and the mass concentration of PM2.5 and PM10. With dense filling of the atmosphere with smoke aerosol from 10 to 14 August, a sharp increase in AOD (tau(0.5)> 0.47) at st. Boyarsk to the absolute maximum on August 11 (tau(0.5)> 0.57) was noted. At the same time, an increase in the mass concentrations of PM2.5 (19-24 mu g/m(3)) and PM10 (42-59 mu g/m(3)) was recorded.

Use of biomarkers, porphyrins, and trace elements to assess the origin, maturity, biodegradation, and migration of Alturitas oils in Venezuela	FUEL												This work is an analysis of crude oil samples from thirty wells in the Alturitas Field (Lake Maracaibo Basin, western Venezuela). Different biomarkers, ten trace elements, and porphyrins were analysed using GC-MS, ICP-OES and UV-visible techniques, respectively. The characterization of these crude oils leads us to conclude that they all fall into a single non-biodegraded oil family derived from a single pulse of hydrocarbon generation, migration and accumulation from the thermally mature calcareous La Luna source rock deposited in an anoxic marine palaeoenvironment under reducing conditions. The main objective of this work is to present a secondary oil migration model for the Marcelina reservoir of the Alturitas Field. The multivariate statistical study of trace-element concentrations, porphyrin contents, and polar compound proportions shows that these parameters can be split into two groups. The first group (Cd, Cu, Mo, Fe, P, Zn, Ca, and Mg) indicates a chalcophic association (Cd, Cu, Mo, and Zn) or colloidal complexes with naphthenic acids (Ca, Mg, and Fe). The other two trace elements (V and Ni), together with porphyrins and polar compounds, reveal that oil compositions has been affected by geochromatography, indicating a highly probable secondary migration pathway along a preferential axis orientated southeast to northwest.

Observations of high level of ozone at Qinghai Lake basin in the northeastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, western China	JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY												Measurements of surface ozone (O-3), nitrogen oxides (NOx = NO + NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and dew point were made at Qinghai Lake (QHL), China, a basin in the remote Tibetan Plateau area, in October 2010 and October 2011. The O-3 mixing ratio was found to be high with average of 41 +/- 9 ppb in October 2010 and 57 +/- 10 ppb in October 2011. The observed diurnal pattern of O-3 mixing ratio was characterized by a minimum between 07:00 and 10:00 local standard time (LST) increasing 20 ppb to a broad peak occurring between 13:00 and 18:00 LST. This diurnal pattern differs substantially from that observed at WMO's GAW Baseline Observatory located above the basin on Mount Waliguan, 130 km southeast of QHL. The elevated O-3 mixing ratios observed in the afternoon are attributed to in situ photochemical production in the air trapped in the QHL basin by surrounding mountains. The low O-3 mixing ratios observed in the morning are most likely due to surface removal in a shallow nocturnal boundary layer. The data indicate substantial impacts of pollution on air quality even in this remote area. The high O-3 values observed in 2011 may cause observable damage to the vegetation, adding stress to an ecosystem ready under the threat of desertification.					schwarz, joshua/G-4556-2013; Junji, Cao/D-3259-2014; Fahey, David/G-4499-2013; Gao, Ru-Shan/H-7455-2013; Wang, Qiyuan/P-8867-2014; Hu, Tafeng/I-8607-2014; Xu, Xiaobin/B-3844-2012; shen, zhenxing/P-8430-2014; wang, ping/AAZ-3665-2021; Huang, Ru-Jin/K-5022-2018	Fahey, David/0000-0003-1720-0634; Huang, Ru-Jin/0000-0002-4907-9616; Wang, Ping/0000-0003-2932-0617													0167-7764	1573-0662				MAR	2015	72	1					19	26		10.1007/s10874-015-9301-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10874-015-9301-9													WOS:000352975400002

The Distribution of Surface Soil Moisture over Space and Time in Eastern Taylor Valley, Antarctica	REMOTE SENSING												Available soil moisture is thought to be the limiting factor for most ecosystem processes in the cold polar desert of the McMurdo Dry Valleys (MDVs) of Antarctica. Previous studies have shown that microfauna throughout the MDVs are capable of biological activity when sufficient soil moisture is available (similar to 2-10% gravimetric water content), but few studies have attempted to quantify the distribution, abundance, and frequency of soil moisture on scales beyond that of traditional field work or local field investigations. In this study, we present our work to quantify the soil moisture content of soils throughout the Fryxell basin using multispectral satellite remote sensing techniques. Our efforts demonstrate that ecologically relevant abundances of liquid water are common across the landscape throughout the austral summer. On average, the Fryxell basin of Taylor Valley is modeled as containing 1.5 +/- 0.5% gravimetric water content (GWC) across its non-fluvial landscape with similar to 23% of the landscape experiencing an average GWC > 2% throughout the study period, which is the observed limit of soil nematode activity. These results indicate that liquid water in the soils of the MDVs may be more abundant than previously thought, and that the distribution and availability of liquid water is dependent on both soil properties and the distribution of water sources. These results can also help to identify ecological hotspots in the harsh polar Antarctic environment and serve as a baseline for detecting future changes in the soil hydrological regime.

SETTING: John A. Moran Eye Center, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA. DESIGN: Experimental study. METHODS: Bilateral phacoemulsification was performed in 14 rabbits; 1 eye received the accommodating IOL (Fluidvision) and the other received a hydrophobic acrylic control IOL. Slitlamp examinations were performed at postoperative weeks 1 to 4 and months 2, 3, 4, and 6. Six rabbits were humanely killed at 2 months and 8 rabbits at 6 months. After gross examination with the Miyake-Apple view, selected IOLs were removed for implant cytology. All globes were then sectioned and processed for histopathologic examination. RESULTS: Uveal biocompatibility of study and control IOLs was similar in clinical and pathologic examinations up to 6 months postoperatively. In the study group, anterior capsule opacification appeared absent and posterior capsule opacification (PCO) was significantly less than in the control group. At the gross examination at 6 months, central PCO was 0.8 +/- 0.5 (SD) in the study IOLs and 3.7 +/- 0.4 in the control IOLs (P < .0001, 2-tailed paired t test). Histopathologic examination confirmed the relative lack of capsule opacification in study eyes compared with controls and the absence of untoward inflammatory reaction or toxicity in all eyes. CONCLUSIONS: The accommodating IOL maintained an expanded capsular bag secondary to the large size of the haptic elements without significant contact with the anterior capsule. This appeared to prevent overall capsular bag opacification and to retain uveal and capsular biocompatibility.																			0886-3350	1873-4502				DEC	2014	40	12					2113	2119		10.1016/j.jcrs.2014.10.011	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcrs.2014.10.011								25465689					WOS:000346460400025

UV photoprotectants in arctic zooplankton	AQUATIC BIOLOGY												High latitude zooplankton must contend with continuous ultraviolet (UV) exposure in summer, increased UVB fluxes as a result of stratospheric ozone depletion and little UV protection from their transparent waters. In the present study, we evaluated the presence and concentration of 4 types of UV-protectants in arctic zooplankton: carotenoids, melanins, scytonemin and mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs). We analysed 12 commonly occurring crustacean species from 27 freshwater bodies in northern Canada and Alaska. Pigments were detected in all species, and most populations had multiple pigments, suggesting a combination of photoprotection strategies, including broadband screening of UV radiation and carotenoid quenching of reactive oxygen species. Scytonemin,. a UVA-screening pigment of cyanobacterial origin that has not been previously detected in zooplankton, was found in 2 crustacean species: the cladoceran Daphnia midden-dorffiana and the fairy shrimp Branchinecta paludosa. MAAs were detected in all populations, providing the first records of high concentrations of these compounds in the genus Daphnia (1 mu g mg(-1)) and in the fairy shrimp Artemiopsis stefanssoni (up to 37 mu g mg(-1)), Concurrent analyses of food sources showed that scytonemin, carotenoids and MAAs in zooplankton originated in phytoplankton or benthic algal mats. Thus, in addition to providing a measure of UV protection, the pigments also indicate zooplankton food sources and potential benthic-pelagic coupling.

A novel submersedRotala rotundifoliawas separately cultivated at room and low temperatures to investigate its ability for nutrient removal. The physiological metabolism was analyzed to explore the mechanism of removing nutrients under a wide temperature range.

Metallic elements and Pb isotopes in PM2.5in three Chinese typical megacities: spatial distribution and source apportionment	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-PROCESSES & IMPACTS												Heavy metal pollution in fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is a serious environmental and health concern in China, particularly during winter. Here, we detected 40 elements in 24 h integrated daily PM(2.5)samples collected in January 2014 from three typical Chinese metropolises (Beijing, Changchun, and Chengdu) to reflect elemental spatial variations, local sources, and regional transport. The measured elemental concentrations in Changchun were 11.1% and 48.4% higher than those in Beijing and Chengdu, respectively. Thus, PM(2.5)from Changchun exhibited high levels and diversity in the elemental profile (characterized by high concentrations of industrial emission elemental markers). The results of elemental ratios and Pb isotopes proved that, except for a coal combustion source, vehicular emissions contributed more to PM(2.5)heavy metals in Beijing than in the other two cities; Changchun PM(2.5)elements received large contributions from industrial sources, including iron and steel manufacturing, and automobile industry. Moreover, crustal dust from long-range transport of regional air masses from the northwest regions of China played a crucial role in determining elemental levels in Beijing and Changchun, accounting for more than 50% of source intensity. However, a specific dominant source was not determined in Chengdu; the contribution of anthropogenic dust, mainly from construction activities, needs to be paid attention in Chengdu eastern area. This study contributed to enhancing our understanding of elemental spatial distribution characteristics and sources and to setting more judicious standards and strategies for PM(2.5)bound heavy metals in China.

J	Li, Q				Li, Quan			Solar forcing of desert vegetation and drought frequency during the last 2700 years in the interior Qaidam Basin, northeastern Tibetan Plateau	SCIENCE CHINA-EARTH SCIENCES												Knowledge of long-term change in vegetation and climate in semi-arid/arid regions is essential for the study of current climate and development of mitigation strategies against severe drought. Here, a fossil pollen record of annually-varved core from Sugan Lake in interior Qaidam Basin was quantitatively analyzed to reconstruct changes in vegetation, floristic diversity and drought frequency. Results of biomization suggested that regional vegetation was desert vegetation with three short-term occupations of temperate steppe/xerophytic shrub during the last 2700 years. Floristic diversity generally increased/decreased with the expansion/degradation of desert vegetation. Moisture fluctuations showed three distinct stages (extremely dry between 742BC and similar to AD500, relatively wet with an increasing trend between similar to AD500 and 1200 and relatively wet with frequent fluctuations after AD1200), interrupted by 14 drought events. Spectral analysis and continuous wavelet transform of moisture variation revealed 200- and 120-year cycles. According to cross-wavelet transform analysis, major drought frequency of similar to 200-year was explicitly correlated to solar activity. It's suggested that the centennial-scale drought frequency was mainly driven by solar activity, through modulation of large-scale atmospheric circulation. Furthermore, the effect of surface temperature-evaporation and uplifting/subsiding air flow should be notable. The climatic drought in interior Qaidam Basin could be intensified under the continuous global warming.

The activities, as presented in this paper, are part of a project driven by European Heritage Volunteers in partnership with the GFA Consulting Group, the Transboundary Biosphere Reserve Prespa Project and with the collaboration of Polytechnic University of Valencia. This joined partnership has made possible the creation of a document "Guidelines for interventions at vernacular architecture at Great Prespa Lake" as following explained. The guidelines are finally aiming to all the villages of the Biosphere Reserve of UNESCO, but the result has been possible thanks specially to the study - in detail - of one of the rural communities located in the region - Zaroshke. The village has been selected and analyzed as a possible pilot project for conservation polices and community involvement, during the summer of 2021, thanks to the participation of local communities and international volunteers (students and young professionals) trough the systematic documentation of vernacular architecture of the village.

J	Meyers, E; Arellano, C; Cowger, C				Meyers, Emily; Arellano, Consuelo; Cowger, Christina			Sensitivity of the US Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici Population to Demethylation Inhibitor Fungicides	PLANT DISEASE												Wheat powdery mildew, caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici, is managed in the United States with cultivar resistance and foliar fungicides. Despite high levels of fungicide sensitivity in other cereal mildew populations, fungicide sensitivity of U.S. B. graminis f. sp. tritici has never been evaluated. Almost 400 B. graminis f. sp. tritici isolates were collected from 15 U.S. states over 2 years and phenotyped for sensitivity to two widely used demethylation inhibitor (DMI) fungicides, tebuconazole and prothioconazole. A large range of sensitivity to both DMIs was observed, with more insensitive isolates originating from the eastern United States (Great Lakes, Mid-Atlantic, and Southeast regions) and more sensitive isolates from central states (Plains region, Arkansas, and Missouri). Cross-resistance was indicated by a positive although weak association between tebuconazole and prothioconazole sensitivities at all levels of analysis (EC50 values, P < 0.0001). A possible fitness cost was also associated with prothioconazole insensitivity (P = 0.0307) when analyzed at the state population level. This is the first assessment of fungicide sensitivity in the U.S. B. graminis f. sp. tritici population, and it produced evidence of regional selection for reduced DMI efficacy. The observation of reduced sensitivity to DMI fungicides in the eastern United States underlines the importance of rotating between chemistry classes to maintain the effectiveness of DMIs in U.S. wheat production. Although cross-resistance was demonstrated, variability in the relationship of EC50 values for tebuconazole and prothioconazole also suggests that multiple mechanisms influence B. graminis f. sp. tritici isolate responses to these two DMI fungicides.

J	Huang, XY; Xue, JT; Wang, XX; Meyers, PA; Huang, JH; Xie, SC				Huang, Xianyu; Xue, Jiantao; Wang, Xinxin; Meyers, Philip A.; Huang, Junhua; Xie, Shucheng			Paleoclimate influence on early diagenesis of plant triterpenes in the Dajiuhu peatland, central China	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												Aromatic derivatives of vascular plant triterpenoids are common in recent and ancient sediments, coal, and petroleum. Understanding their early diagenetic alterations and their relation with environmental conditions can facilitate their applications in paleoenvironmental reconstructions. Here we present a high-resolution record of aromatic triterpenes in a Holocene peat core collected in the Dajiuhu peatland, central China. These aromatic triterpenes are derivatives of plant triterpenoids with oleanane, ursane and lupane carbon skeletons and exist in three different structural groups: aromatic des-A-triterpenes, aromatic pentacyclic triterpenes, and C-ring cleaved aromatic triterpenes. Such a high diversity of aromatic triterpenes in a young peat deposit is compelling evidence for rapid microbial mediation of these important degradation pathways during very early diagenesis. Of particular importance is the occurrence of C-ring cleaved aromatic triterpene and aromatic des-A-triterpenes in the Dajiuhu peat samples, which until now have not been identified in recent sediments. The downcore profile shows that the microbial aromatization process of oleanoids positively correlates with paleoclimate change. During dry or warm intervals, highly aromatized products such as tetraaromatic triterpenes become predominant over their triaromatic homologs. In contrast, triaromatic triterpenes become dominant during wet or cold intervals. In addition, this study provides further evidence to support that the climate pattern in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River is different from that in north China during 13-9.4 ka. These findings suggest that aromatic triterpenes can be valuable tools for Holocene paleoenvironmental reconstructions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This study examined the long- and short-term trends from stream discharge and rainfall data in the Lake Kariba Catchment. A trend and change point analysis was carried out on the mean, minimum and maximum monthly average time series for 14 gauging stations that are located within the Kariba catchment. The Mann-Kendall and the Pettitt tests were used to determine the trend and any changes in the long-term average of the time series. The magnitude of the trend was determined by Sen's slope method. The results indicate that generally there has been a decreasing trend in river and rainfall long-term mean values across the catchment. A statistically significant trend (p <= 0.05) was observed at Zambezi River at Lukulu, Senanga and Victoria Falls, with a positive correlation in Pearsons's coefficient of water levels and rainfall at Lukulu (0.312) and Senanga (0.365). The decrease in the time series trend and the change point observed have been attributed to anthropogenic activities, climate change and variability impact on the catchment. The findings are critical for climate risk management and reduction decisions for near- and long-term timescales.					; chimuka, luke/LOR-9818-2024; Banda, Kawawa/JXN-6128-2024	Uchida, Yoshi/0000-0002-8677-9945; Banda, Kawawa/0000-0001-7083-3014; 													1998-9563	2224-7955				JUL	2024	55	7					683	710		10.2166/nh.2024.122	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/nh.2024.122		JUN 2024											WOS:001249712300001
J	Howey, MCL				Howey, Meghan C. L.			Other-Than-Human Persons, Mishipishu, and Danger in the Late Woodland Inland Waterway Landscape of Northern Michigan	AMERICAN ANTIQUITY												Other-than-human persons and the role they play in transforming social, economic, and ideological material realities is an area of expanding interest in archaeology. Although the Anishinaabeg were an early and vital focus of cultural anthropological studies on nonhumans given their significant relationships with other-than-human persons, known to them as manitou, emerging archaeologies advancing this topic are not largely centered on ancestral Anishinaabeg sites and artifacts. This article analyzes a set of nonvessel ceramic artifacts from Late Woodland archaeological sites in the Inland Waterway in northern Michigan, which are interpreted to be ceramic renderings of manitou. I argue that these were manitou-in-clay, vibrant relational entities that are brought into being for and through use in ceremonial perspective practices related to Mishipishu-a complexly powerful, seductive, and dangerous nonhuman being known as the head of all water spirits. I contextualize the making and breaking of Mishipishu manitou-in-clay as acts of petition by hunter-fishers who had been seduced by this manitou in dreams, as they headed out on necessary but high-risk early-spring resource harvesting in the inland lakes of the Inland Waterway. This case advances insights into how relationships with other-than-human persons were coproductive of the world in the northern Great Lakes region during the Late Woodland period.																			0002-7316	2325-5064				APR	2020	85	2					347	366	PII S0002731619001021	10.1017/aaq.2019.102	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/aaq.2019.102													WOS:000527741100009
J	DAM, G; SURLYK, F				DAM, G; SURLYK, F			FORCED REGRESSIONS IN A LARGE WAVE-DOMINATED AND STORM-DOMINATED ANOXIC LAKE, RHAETIAN-SINEMURIAN KAP STEWART FORMATION, EAST GREENLAND	GEOLOGY												During Rhaetian-Sinemurian time a large wave- and storm-dominated lake was situated in the Jameson Land basin, East Greenland. Lake deposits consist of alternating black unfossiliferous mudstones and sheet sandstones. Anoxic conditions dominated at the lake bottom during deposition of the muds, and the water column was probably stratified. The sandstones were deposited by progradation of wave- and storm-dominated deltas in a water depth of less than 15 m. Sequence-stratigraphic interpretation suggests that the mudstones were deposited in periods of rising and very high stands of lake level whereas progradation of the deltaic sheet sandstones took place during forced regressions caused by significant falls. The lake thus underwent a large number of fairly high amplitude changes in level, probably caused by climatic fluctuations. The high-order cycles can be grouped into several long-period cycles that show that same number of major fluctuations as published eustatic sea-level curves. This similarity suggests a causal link between eustasy and long-period variations in the lake. The Kap Stewart Formation represents one of the few ancient examples of a large wave- and storm-dominated lake, and it is probably the first documented case of abundant well-developed lacustrine forced regressions.

J	Laird, N; Sobash, R; Hodas, N				Laird, Neil; Sobash, Ryan; Hodas, Natasha			Climatological Conditions of Lake-Effect Precipitation Events Associated with the New York State Finger Lakes	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY												A climatological analysis was conducted of the environmental and atmospheric conditions that occurred during 125 identified lake-effect (LE) precipitation events in the New York State Finger Lakes region for the 11 winters (October-March) from 1995/96 through 2005/06. The results complement findings from an earlier study reporting on the frequency and temporal characteristics of Finger Lakes LE events that occurred as 1) isolated precipitation bands over and downwind of a lake (NYSFL events), 2) an enhancement of LE precipitation originating from Lake Ontario (LOenh events), 3) an LE precipitation band embedded within widespread synoptic precipitation (SYNOP events), or 4) a transition from one type to another. In comparison with SYNOP and LOenh events, NYSFL events developed with the 1) coldest temperatures, 2) largest lake-air temperature differences, 3) weakest wind speeds, 4) highest sea level pressure, and 5) lowest height of the stable-layer base. Several significant differences in conditions were found when only one or both of Cayuga and Seneca Lakes, the largest Finger Lakes, had LE precipitation as compared with when the smaller Finger Lakes also produced LE precipitation. In addition, transitional events containing an NYSFL time period occurred in association with significantly colder and drier air masses, larger lake-air temperature differences, and a less stable and shallower boundary layer in comparison with those associated with solitary NYSFL events.

The changes in precipitation throughout the Holocene, as well as its long-term characteristics in arid northwest China, are not well understood, and records to reconstruct the precipitation trends are needed. Therefore, this study established a well-dated black carbon (BC) stable isotope-inferred (delta C-13) precipitation record based on a sediment core from Sayram Lake, Tianshan Mountains (Xinjiang province, northwest China). The record spans the last 12880 cal. yr BP. Variations in BC delta C-13 showed that between similar to 12280 and 9260 cal. yr BP, regional precipitation gradually decreased, but then increased continually until the present, with millennial to centennial scale fluctuations. During the Holocene, a distinct period of low precipitation was observed between 9800 and 8800 cal. yr BP, and two episodes of high precipitation were observed between 8000 and 7600, and 5800 and 2500 cal. yr BP. The maximum precipitation occurred at similar to 3800 cal. yr BP. Generally, the persistently increasing precipitation trend is consistent with other records from arid northwest China and adjacent areas. The trend was possibly controlled by Northern Hemisphere solar insolation and associated substantial ice sheet remnants, due to the influence of the North Atlantic Ocean sea surface temperatures and intensities of the Westerlies, which regulate the transport of water vapor to Xinjiang. The results provide a better understanding of the mechanisms driving the evolution of precipitation through the Holocene.					; qf, Jiang/AGY-9132-2022; Yang, Yufeng/ABS-0346-2022	Jiang, Qingfeng/0000-0003-3518-4279; Jiang, Qingfeng/0000-0003-2489-6801; 														2296-6463				JUL 17	2020	8								228	10.3389/feart.2020.00228	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/feart.2020.00228													WOS:000556802400001

Long-term time series on metabolic rates are commonly estimated from diel changes in dissolved oxygen. Here we present long-term data on metabolic rates based on diel changes in total dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) utilizing an open-water diel CO2-technique. Metabolic rates estimated with this technique and the traditional diel O-2-technique agree well in alkaline Lake Illmensee (pHof-8.5), although the diel changes in molar CO2 concentrations are much smaller than those of the molar O-2 concentrations. The open-water diel CO2- and diel O-2-techniques provide independent measures of lake metabolic rates that differ in their sensitivity to transport processes. Hence, the combination of both techniques can help to constrain uncertainties arising from assumptions on vertical fluxes due to gas exchange and turbulent diffusion. This is particularly important for estimates of lake respiration rates because these are much more sensitive to assumptions on gradients in vertical fluxes of O-2 or DIC than estimates of lake gross primary production. Our data suggest that it can be advantageous to estimate respiration rates assuming negligible gradients in vertical fluxes rather than including gas exchange with the atmosphere but neglecting vertical mixing in the water column. During two months in summer the average lake net production was close to zero suggesting at most slightly autotrophic conditions. However, the lake emitted O-2 and CO2 during the entire time period suggesting that O-2 and CO2 emissions from lakes can be decoupled from the metabolism in the near surface layer.

Lake Starzyc also called Chociwel is located in West Pomeranian Voivodeship and is adjacent to the town of Chociwel from South and South East of the city. In the collected material of the analysed lake macrozoobenthos organisms from the following classes were found: Oligochaeta, Hirudinea, Crustacea, Insecta and Bivalvia. The Insecta class was the most numerous one in respect of species found, including larvae of the following orders: Ephemeroptera (Leptophlebia sp., Ephemera sp., Caenis macrura (Stephens)), Trichoptera (Limnephilidae, Leptoceridae, Cyrnus sp.) Diptera and Megaloptera (Sialis lutaria L.). The density and biomass distribution in the analysed Starzyc Lake demonstrates the occurrence of unfavourable changes which may lead to eutrophication in the shallowest layers of the body reservoir and in the zone at the depth of 4.9 m. The littoral zone of the studied lake features high density and significant benthic fauna biomass with low values of PIE biodiversity index.																			2299-8993					OCT	2013	14	4					1	8		10.5604/2081139X.1066188	http://dx.doi.org/10.5604/2081139X.1066188													WOS:000436670700001
J	Vavrus, S; Notaro, M; Zarrin, A				Vavrus, Steve; Notaro, Michael; Zarrin, Azar			The Role of Ice Cover in Heavy Lake-Effect Snowstorms over the Great Lakes Basin as Simulated by RegCM4	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW												A 20-km regional climate model, the Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics Regional Climate Model version 4 (ICTP RegCM4), is employed to investigate heavy lake-effect snowfall (HLES) over the Great Lakes Basin and the role of ice cover in regulating these events. When coupled to a lake model and driven with atmospheric reanalysis data between 1976 and 2002, RegCM4 reproduces the major characteristics of HLES. The influence of lake ice cover on HLES is investigated through 10 case studies (2 per Great Lake), in which a simulated heavy lake-effect event is compared with a companion simulation having 100% ice cover imposed on one or all of the Great Lakes. These experiments quantify the impact of ice cover on downstream snowfall and demonstrate that Lake Superior has the strongest, most widespread influence on heavy snowfall and Lake Ontario the least. Ice cover strongly affects a wide range of atmospheric variables above and downstream of lakes during HLES, including snowfall, surface energy fluxes, wind speed, temperature, moisture, clouds, and air pressure. Averaged among the 10 events, complete ice coverage causes major reductions in lake-effect snowfall (>80%) and turbulent heat fluxes over the lakes (>90%), less low cloudiness, lower temperatures, and higher air pressure. Another important consequence is a consistent weakening (30%-40%) of lower-tropospheric winds over the lakes when completely frozen. This momentum reduction further decreases over-lake evaporation and weakens downstream wind convergence, thus mitigating lake-effect snowfall.

Polar bear predation on swimming flightless greater snow geese and estimation of energetic efficiency	ARCTIC SCIENCE												As sea -ice cover is shrinking, polar bears (Ursus maritimus, Phipps, 1774) face decreased access to seals, their primary prey, resulting in a greater dependence on terrestrial food sources. Whether polar bears can benefit from these terrestrial food sources, however, depends on their ability to find and capture prey items without expending more energy than is acquired. Here, we report one of the northernmost observations of polar bear predation on adult birds. The bear used a dive -hunting technique, which consisted of submerging itself, approaching underwater, and catching flightless greater snow geese (Anser caerulescens caerulescens (Linnaeus, 1758)) from beneath the surface of a tundra pond. After evaluating energy expenditures during swimming and energy intakes from consuming geese, we estimated that this rarely documented dive -hunting technique could be energetically profitable for a certain range of pursuit durations. This observation highlights the behavioral plasticity that polar bears can deploy to punctually exploit land -based food sources.					; Poirier, Mathilde/AAG-7844-2021; LeTourneux, Frédéric/HCH-7838-2022; Broin, Frédéric/AAF-7469-2021	Weiss-Blais, Matthieu/0000-0002-8049-5271; Grandmont, Thierry/0000-0003-0557-8197; LeTourneux, Frederic/0000-0003-4048-2828; Legagneux, Pierre/0000-0002-6366-0554; Poirier, Mathilde/0000-0002-4114-0099; Dulude-de Broin, Frederic/0000-0003-4955-156X; Corbeil-Robitaille, Madeleine-Zoe/0000-0002-8324-1381; Bolduc, David/0000-0003-0851-2791; 														2368-7460				MAR	2024	10	1					233	239		10.1139/AS-2023-0036	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/AS-2023-0036		JAN 2024											WOS:001153098800001

In the present study, the trophic cascade was tested by examining the effects of stocking with common carp on plankton and periphytic microphytes. Before stocking, the phytoplankton community was dominated by the chrysophyte Synura uvella. In the epilithon and epiphyton, the predominant diatoms were prostrate, stalk-forming, and motile taxa representing an important food source for adult copepods. After stocking, phytoplankton biomass declined and the community shifted towards small centric diatoms, allowing the small-bodied zooplankton to exploit them. The lower biomass of adult copepods allowed rotifers to proliferate and exploit phytoplankton, while small cladocerans and nauplii fed primarily on epilithon. One month after stocking, phytoplankton was dominated by cryptophytes, small centric diatoms and chlorophytes, which were an important food for rotifers, while none of the zooplankton groups showed a significant relationship with the epilithic and epiphytic communities. By the end of the experiment, food was scarce due to reduced biomass of autotrophs, and zooplankton possibly began to feed on other sources. Our results add to the knowledge about the trophic cascade hypothesis in small shallow reservoirs.

Changing Nature of High-Impact Snowfall Events in Eastern North America	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Snowstorms cause substantial disruption in the eastern United States and Canada each winter. While reductions in annual snowfall are projected over most of this region due to anthropogenic global warming, daily snowfall extremes that have the greatest impact may not decrease in the same manner. We examine changes to two extreme snowfall metrics: the 95th percentile of daily snowfall (SF95, cm) and the number of events during which 10% of the mean annual snowfall is exceeded during a single day (TC10, events yr (-1)). We explore changes to these metrics in two ensembles of the fifth-generation Canadian Regional Climate Model, including four 0.22 degrees (approximate to 25 km) simulations driven by different coupled general circulation models as well as the higher-resolution (0.11 degrees, approximate to 12 km) ClimEx ensemble, driven by 50 members of a large initial-condition ensemble of one global model. We find that while mean annual snowfall is projected to decrease over our domain, SF95 is projected to remain relatively constant, suggesting that the most extreme daily snowfalls currently observed are likely to occur even in a warmer future climate. The region of the largest TC10 values exhibits a northward shift, with a larger percentage of annual snowfall occurring during a few large events along the U.S.-Canada border. These projected changes to the nature of snowfall events may have important socioeconomic consequences in this densely populated region of North America.					; Schmidt, Gavin/D-4427-2012; McCray, Christopher/HKW-0038-2023; Leduc, Martin/ABI-5721-2020	Paquin, Dominique/0000-0002-1353-930X; Schmidt, Gavin/0000-0002-2258-0486; McCray, Christopher/0000-0001-5594-9115; 													2169-897X	2169-8996				JUL 16	2023	128	13							e2023JD038804	10.1029/2023JD038804	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2023JD038804													WOS:001025106500001

In the pelagial of lakes, about 20 urotrich species occur throughout an annual cycle, some of which play a pivotal role in aquatic food webs. For example, during the phytoplankton spring bloom, they consume a remarkable proportion of the algal production. In ecological studies, urotrich ciliates are usually merely identified to genus rank and grouped into size classes. This is unsatisfying considering the distinct autecological properties of individual species and their specific spatial and temporal distribution patterns. As a basis for future research, we characterized in detail four common urotrich morphotypes, i.e., specimens identified as U. furcata and tentatively as U. agilis, U. pseudofurcata, and U. castalia, using state-of-the-art methods. We used an integrative polyphasic approach, in which morphological studies (in vivo observation, silver staining methods, scanning electron microscopy) were linked with a molecular approach exploiting four different gene fragments as taxonomic DNA barcodes with different resolution potential (SSU rDNA, ITS-1, ITS-2, hypervariable V4 and V9 regions of the SSU rDNA). We shed light on the diversity of urotrich ciliates as well as on their global distribution patterns, and annual cycles. Additionally, we coupled individual species occurrences and environmental parameters, and subsequently modeled the distribution and occurrence, using logistic regressions. Furthermore, for one strain putatively identified as U. castalia, we ascertained the optimal cultivation media and food preferences. Thereby, our comprehensive view on these important freshwater ciliates that frequently occur in environmental high throughput sequencing datasets worldwide will allow future studies to better exploit protistan plankton data from lakes.

Cause and Process Mechanism of Rockslide Triggered Flood Event in Rishiganga and Dhauliganga River Valleys, Chamoli, Uttarakhand, India Using Satellite Remote Sensing and in situ Observations	JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING												The catchments of Rishiganga and then Dhauliganga valleys in the Chamoli district of Uttarakhand were impacted by a catastrophic flood triggered due to a massive rockslide, caused by wedge failure on 7th February, 2021. It is estimated that the massive rockslide of similar to 23 million cubic meter volume containing base rock, deposited ice, and snow got detached from the northern slopes of the Trishul mountain range near Ronti Glacier and created a vertical fall of almost 1700 m before severely impacting the Ronti Gad valley located at 1.5 km downstream of Ronti Glacier snout. The huge detached mass of rock and ice (GLIMS ID: G079733E30381N) swiftly moved downstream through the glaciated valley entraining snow, debris, mud on its way, caused rapid fluidization, created massive water/slush waves, and washed away partially or completely the hydel power projects and bridges in its route. It is estimated that similar to 0.93 Peta Joules of potential energy led to the generation of a significant amount of kinetic and thermal energy, good enough to trigger above-mentioned processes. Post-event analysis of high-resolution satellite data shows flood water marks in the valley and on the rock outcrops reaching up to similar to 80-150 m height on the way to Raini Village. The mud and the slush produced through this process led to the formation of a dammed lake and temporarily blocked one of the tributaries of the Rishiganga joining from the northeast. This study provides an insight into the sequence of events as they unfolded, through multi-temporal satellite image analysis, aerial survey, seismological data in conjunction with various other geo-spatial and geo-visualization tools for unraveling the flood event that has happened on February 7, 2021. We also discuss the potential cause of rockslide and the process mechanism of this unique event, causing loss of lives and property besides widespread devastation.					; KANNAUJIYA, SURESH/JDV-9886-2023; Thakur, Praveen/G-4295-2010; Chopra, Sumer/AAU-1511-2020; Bhardwaj, Dr. Ashutosh/E-4980-2016; BHATT, CM/AAU-2453-2021; Kumar, Santosh/H-6770-2016	KANNAUJIYA, SURESH/0000-0002-6191-2092; Bhardwaj, Dr. Ashutosh/0000-0002-9241-5427; , Prakash/0000-0002-8273-3501; Dhote, Pankaj R./0000-0002-3483-0059; 													0255-660X	0974-3006				MAY	2021	49	5					1011	1024		10.1007/s12524-021-01360-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12524-021-01360-3		APR 2021											WOS:000636942600001
J	Kadlec, RH				Kadlec, Robert H.			Wastewater treatment at the Houghton lake wetland: Soils and sediments	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												This paper describes the sediment and soils responses in a very long-running study of the capacity of a natural peatland to remove nutrients from treated wastewater. Data are here presented and analyzed from three decades of full-scale operation (1978-2007), during which large changes in the wetland soils occurred. An average of 600,000 m(3) y(-1) of treated water was discharged each warm season to the Porter Ranch peatland near the community of Houghton Lake, Michigan. This discharge was seasonal, commencing no sooner than May 1 and ending no later than October 31. During the winter half-year, treated wastewater was stored at the lagoon site. This water contained 3.5 mg/L of total phosphorus, and 7 mg/L of dissolved inorganic nitrogen. Nutrients were stored in the 100 ha irrigation area, which removed 94% of the phosphorus (53 t) and 95% of the dissolved inorganic nitrogen. Phosphorus was stored in new biomass, increased soil sorption, and accretion of new soils and sediments, with accretion being dominant. Peat probings, water level increases and topographical surveys established quantitative measures of soil accretion. Over 30 cm of new soil developed, in which nutrient storage occurred. Phosphorus concentrations in the new soil were approximately 2000 mg P/kg, and the nitrogen concentration was 2-3%DW. The removal of TSS was effective, but minor in comparison to the internal generation and cycling of produced particulates. Later in the project history, the interior portion of impacted area became a floating mat. Sedimentation processes then occurred with no exposure to above-mat detrital processes. Trace element analyses showed no appreciable accumulation of heavy metals, other than the calcium and iron that characterized the antecedent wetland and the incoming water. Biomass cycling models were found to produce reasonable estimates of the measured nutrient accumulations. The light loadings of nutrients to this system produced dramatic effects in the ecosystem, but were lower than the range seen in some other treatment wetlands. Insufficient nitrogen was added to support the new biomass, and nitrogen fixation was identified as a possible compensatory mechanism. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

J	Pan, B; Ding, T; Zhu, ZJ; Wei, SH				Pan, Bing; Ding, Ting; Zhu, Zhijun; Wei, Shaohua			Characteristics and Material Sources of Global Brine-Type Lithium Deposits	GEOLOGICAL JOURNAL												Lithium brine deposits are mainly distributed in the three major plateaus of the world: the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in China, the Andean Plateau in South America and the Western Plateau in North America, forming the three major lithium ore-forming regions in the world. The lithium-rich salt lakes on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in China include Zabuye Salt Lake, Nam Co Salt Lake and Da Qaidam Salt Lake. The lithium-rich salt lakes on the Andean Plateau in South America mainly include Uyuni Salt Lake and Atacama Salt Lake, while the lithium-rich salt lakes on the Western Plateau in North America mainly include the Salton Sea and Clayton Valley. Based on a large amount of data collection, this article analyses the characteristics of the lithium-rich salt lakes on the three plateaus, and concludes that the tectonic background of the lithium-rich salt lakes is mostly associated with subduction-collision orogenic belts, surrounded by abundant igneous rocks. The main source of lithium is deep-seated hydrothermal fluids leaching lithium from rocks and bringing it to the surface in the form of hot springs, replenishing the salt lakes.

As interest in the community structure of aquatic life is growing, there is need for more standardized and replicable methods for acquiring underwater census data. Here, we propose a novel approach, Point-Combination Transect (PCT), which makes use of automated image recording by small digital cameras to eliminate observer and identification biases associated with available UVC methods. We conducted a pilot study at Lake Tanganyika, demonstrating the applicability of PCT on a taxonomically and phenotypically highly diverse assemblage of fishes, the Tanganyikan cichlid species-flock. We conducted 17 PCTs consisting of five GoPro cameras each and identified 22,867 individual cichlids belonging to 61 species on the recorded images. These data were then used to evaluate our method and to compare it to traditional line transect studies conducted in close proximity to our study site at Lake Tanganyika. We show that the analysis of the second hour of PCT image recordings (equivalent to 360 images per camera) leads to reliable estimates of the benthic cichlid community composition in Lake Tanganyika according to species accumulation curves, while minimizing the effect of disturbance of the fish through SCUBA divers. We further show that PCT is robust against observer biases and outperforms traditional line transect methods.					; Salzburger, Walter/G-1598-2011	Indermaur, Adrian/0000-0002-3048-8911; Ronco, Fabrizia/0000-0003-1583-8108; Widmer, Lukas/0000-0003-2642-8163													2041-210X	2041-2096				JUN	2019	10	6					891	901		10.1111/2041-210X.13163	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.13163								31244987					WOS:000470017200015

Using gas-tight methods, SOC at 7-5 mg .cntdot. L-1 decreased by 75% when the oxygen concentration in respirometers fell to 3-1 mg .cntdot. L-1. With continuous mixing, the comparable decrease in SOC was 50%. Finally, the decrease was less than 30% and obvious only below 2 mg .cntdot. L-1 when the oxygen concentration was held constant in continuous flow respirometers. SOC results using the last procedure were within 10% of the mean SOC calculated indirectly from hypolimnetic oxygen budgets for the two previous years. Thus, mixing and a constant or slowly changing ambient oxygen concentration are required for realistic SOC measurements. In another experiment, oxygen uptake in water overlying the sediment accounted for a large and variable portion of the SOC, often more than 50%. Therefore, it may be impossible to separate the influence of the water and sediment on the HOD.

Characterisation of dissolved organic matter from temperate wetlands: field dynamics and photoreactivity changes driven by natural inputs and diagenesis along the hydroperiod	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Wetlands store large amounts of C in biomass, sediments and water. A major C fraction is in the dissolved organic matter (DOM) with multiple regulatory functions. Patagonian wetlands undergo changes in the water cycle due to climate warming and lower precipitation, causing shorter hydroperiods and reduced landscape connectivity with effects on C budgets. This study focuses on the optical characterisation of the DOM of an ephemeral wetland of North Patagonia. Along the hydroperiod the DOM showed optical signatures indicating terrestrial inputs, degradation and internal production. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration ranged between similar to 4 and similar to 9 mg L-1. The DOM pool displayed high molecular weight/size and aromatic fingerprints. Humic components C1 (microbial and/or vegetation derived) and C2 (soil/sediment) prevailed in the DOM, whereas the non-humic component C3 (from aquatic processes) increased from early spring. Experimental exposure to PAR + UVR produced slight changes in DOC and reduction in DOM molecular weight/size. The components showed distinctive photoreactivity/lability: C1 > C3 > C2. Along the hydroperiod the relative contribution of the humic vs. non-humic components (C1 and C3) determined the reactivity/lability of the DOM. In Fantasma pond, the DOM pool fluctuates in response to hydrology and degradation processes, and the alternance between dry and flooded periods determines C dynamics.					; Garcia, Patricia/AAL-4453-2020	Garcia, Patricia Elizabeth/0000-0002-1471-3090; Dieguez, Maria/0000-0002-8241-3719; 													0028-8330	1175-8805				OCT 2	2023	57	4					480	494		10.1080/00288330.2022.2064882	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288330.2022.2064882		APR 2022											WOS:000789237700001

Sub-monthly time scale forecasting of harmful algal blooms intensity in Lake Erie using remote sensing and machine learning	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Harmful algal blooms of cyanobacteria (CyanoHAB) have emerged as a serious environmental concern in large and small water bodies including many inland lakes. The growth dynamics of CyanoHAB can be chaotic at very short timescales but predictable at coarser timescales. In Lake Erie, cyanobacteria blooms occur in the springsummer months, which, at annual timescale, are controlled by the total spring phosphorus (TP) load into the lake. This study aimed to forecast CyanoHAB cell count at sub-monthly (e.g., 10-day) timescales. Satellitederived cyanobacterial index (CI) was used as a surrogate measure of CyanoHAB cell count. CI was related to the in-situ measured chlorophyll-a and phycocyanin concentrations and Microcystis biovolume in the lake. Using available data on environmental and lake hydrodynamics as predictor variables, four statistical models including LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator), artificial neural network (ANN), random forest (RF), and an ensemble average of the three models (EA) were developed to forecast CI at 10-, 20- and 30-day lead times. The best predictions were obtained by using the RF and EA algorithms. It was found that CyanoHAB growth dynamics, even at sub-monthly timescales, are determined by coarser timescale variables. Meteorological, hydrological, and water quality variations at sub-monthly timescales exert lesser control over CyanoHAB growth dynamics. Nutrients discharged into the lake from rivers other than the Maumee River were also important in explaining the variations in CI. Surprisingly, to forecast CyanoHAB cell count, average solar radiation at 30 to 60 days lags were found to be more important than the average solar radiation at 0 to 30 days lag. Other important variables were TP discharged into the lake during the previous 10 years, TP and TKN discharged into the lake during the previous 120 days, the average water level at 10-day lag and 60-day lag.

C.; Hetland, Robert; Yang, Zhao; Xue, Pengfei			Contrasting effects of lake breeze and urbanization on heat stress in Chicago metropolitan area	URBAN CLIMATE												This study used the latest Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model coupled with multi -layer urban canopy models to investigate contrasting effects from urbanization and lake breeze on summer heat stress over the Chicago metropolitan area (CMA). Comparisons between the model and in situ observations show that this coupled modeling system better captures urban locations' diurnal pattern of surface air temperature, skin temperature and relative humidity, with root mean square error reduced from 1.58 to 1.80 degrees C to 1.14-1.31 degrees C, 3.11-3.55 degrees C to 1.81-2.21 degrees C, and 10.73-11.35% to 7.84-8.60%, respectively, compared to WRF without coupling the urban canopy models. Two sensitivity experiments were conducted to isolate the influence of lake breeze and urbanization: one replaced the urban land use with cropland over the CMA, and the other filled all of Lake Michigan with cropland. Three different heat stress indices were computed to assess the uncertainties of heat stress response to changes in air temperature, relative humidity, and wind conditions. Results show that, when the lake has the largest cooling effect on air temperature, it also increases the relative humidity the most, and vice versa for urban warming and drying effects. Urbanization intensifies heat stress at night, and extends the heat caution period by up to 4 h over inland urban grids; the lake breeze relieves heat stress during afternoon (when the heat stress is the worst), and shortens the heat caution period by 1-3 h over inland urban grids and 3-4 h over coastal urban grids. The intensification of heat stress over the CMA due to urbanization is more than four times greater than the reduction from the lake breeze in the late afternoon and evening.

In contrast to Earth's ecosystems, potential extraterrestrial biotopes are usually characterized by a lack of oxygen. Methods: In the MASE project (Mars Analogues for Space Exploration), we selected representative anoxic analogue environments (permafrost, salt-mine, acidic lake and river, sulfur springs) for the comprehensive analysis of their microbial communities. We assessed the microbiome profile of intact cells by propidium monoazide-based amplicon and shotgun metagenome sequencing, supplemented with an extensive cultivation effort. Results: The information retrieved from microbiome analyses on the intact microbial community thriving in the MASE sites, together with the isolation of 31 model microorganisms and successful binning of 15 high-quality genomes allowed us to observe principle pathways, which pinpoint specific microbial functions in the MASE sites compared to moderate environments. The microorganisms were characterized by an impressive machinery to withstand physical and chemical pressures. All levels of our analyses revealed the strong and omnipresent dependency of the microbial communities on complex organic matter. Moreover, we identified an extremotolerant cosmopolitan group of 34 poly-extremophiles thriving in all sites. Conclusions: Our results reveal the presence of a core microbiome and microbial taxonomic similarities between saline and acidic anoxic environments. Our work further emphasizes the importance of the environmental, terrestrial parameters for the functionality of a microbial community, but also reveals a high proportion of living microorganisms in extreme environments with a high adaptation potential within habitability borders.

At this site, snow avalanches bring minerogenic debris and macroscopic plant remains from the adjacent valley side south of the lake onto the lake ice. When the lake ice melts during late spring, the debris sinks to the lake bottom. A flux record of the number of minerogenic particles > 1 mm per unit time, obtained by combining two sediment cores from the lake, shows a significant increase in snow-avalanche activity after similar to 2000 cal. BR Prior to that, periods with enhanced snow-avalanche activity around the lake occurred - 8500-8300, 8200-7900, 7300-6300, 5900-5400, 5000-4600, 3700-3400, 3100-2800, 2700-2600 and 2500-2300 cal. BP. The snow-avalanche record from western Norway has been compared with a record of Holocene snow-avalanche activity in the More area in western Norway, a record of Holocene river floods in eastern Norway, and Holocene debris-flow events in southern Norway. Knowledge of the past magnitude and frequency of extreme weather events, such as snow avalanches, may help making climate model simulations and scenarios of extreme weather events more reliable.

J	Chronis, T; Koshak, W; McCaul, E				Chronis, T.; Koshak, W.; McCaul, E.			Why do oceanic negative cloud-to-ground lightning exhibit larger peak current values?	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												This study examines the temporal (monthly) and spatial climatology (2004-2010) of the first return stroke of the cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning flash peak current (I-p) across various land/water boundaries over the contiguous United States. Four regions are examined: the Gulf of Mexico (region 1), the Florida peninsula (region 2), Lake Michigan (region 3), and part of the U.S. Mid-Atlantic (region 4). The cross sections across the coastlines of regions 1, 2, and 4 show a gradual oceanward increase in the mean negative polarity CG peak current values (-I-p). This transition along the respective land/ocean boundaries is not sharp but gradual. In direct contrast with ocean, there is no consistent behavior in -I-p values as we move from land out across the fresh water of Lake Michigan (region 3). Meanwhile, the positive CG flash peak current (+I-p) values do not exhibit a consistent variation across any coastal boundary. For region 1, the -I-p values increase as we move toward the coast (southwards) especially during the wet season (June-October). This finding is in direct contrast with studies that documented winter as the season of maximum -I-p values. The zonal and seasonal variations of -I-p values across region 4 are not quite as pronounced, but the oceanic -I-p values are still larger than over the adjoining landmass. We explore in turn which up to date hypotheses pertinent to the oceanic -I-p enhancement are supported or refuted by our findings. It is concluded that the oceanic -I-p enhancement is not an artifact related to CG detection or -I-p retrieval methods, nor is it likely related to the cloud top heights or CG activity. The study cannot refute the role of electrical conductivity and its contribution to CG leader attachment processes. However, given the observed "blurred transition" of the I-p values across the coastlines this paper suggests that likely the main physical mechanism is acting on the thundercloud potential. The recently suggested role of sodium chloride (NaCl) but also the role of ice crystal size (implicated herein), as possible modulators of the thundercloud potential, exhibit distinct pros and cons. Their candidacy is supported by their strong physical links to the electrostatic charging and thundercloud electric potential buildup but also by the exhibited blurred -I-p transition across the coastlines. In contrast, the suggested mechanisms cannot individually explain the observed -I-p enhancement in terms of season, NaCl concentrations, and absence of similar behavior in the respective +I-p values.																			2169-897X	2169-8996				APR 27	2016	121	8					4049	4068		10.1002/2015JD024129	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2015JD024129													WOS:000378318100018
J	Caudell, JN; Conover, MR				Caudell, JN; Conover, MR			Behavioral and physiological responses of Eared Grebes (Podiceps nigricollis) to variations in brine shrimp (Artemia franciscana) densities	WESTERN NORTH AMERICAN NATURALIST												Eared Grebes (Podiceps nigricollis) use the Great Salt Lake (GSL) primarily as a fall staging area. They feed on brine shrimp (Artemia franciscana) to build up energy reserves to complete their southward migration. Whereas it has been speculated that timing of grebe departure from the GSL is due to declining shrimp density, this hypothesis has not been tested. We monitored grebe weight, behavior, and departure dates to test this hypothesis and to determine the effects of declining shrimp densities on Eared Grebes during 1999, 2000, and 2001 when there were different shrimp densities. Despite differences in shrimp densities, grebes left the GSL about the same time each year. juvenile and subadult mass was significantly lighter (P < 0.001) in 1999 than in 2000 or 2001; however, adult grebe mass was similar in 1999 and 2000, despite the large difference in available of food. While there was no difference (P > 0.05) in dive or surface duration between 1999 and 2000, there were differences in the percentage of time spent foraging. Our results indicated that at shrimp densities < 0.1 shrimp (.) L-1, grebes increased their foraging effort to offset the declining food resource instead of departing the GSL at an earlier date.																			1527-0904					JAN	2006	66	1					12	22		10.3398/1527-0904(2006)66[12:BAPROE]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.3398/1527-0904(2006)66[12:BAPROE]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000235530900002

Presented here is a reconstruction of the Quaternary lake-level history as derived from sediment cores from the southern lake shelf. There, a cliff-like bench 10 m below the modern water level has been investigated. Deep-water sediments on the shelf indicate high lake levels during a warm Mid-Pleistocene period. One period with low lake level prior to Marine Oxygen Isotope Stage (MIS) 3 has been identified, followed by a period of high lake level (10 m above present). In the course of MIS 2 the lake level dropped to -10 m. At the end of MIS 2 the bench was formed and coarse beach sedimentation occurred. Subsequently, the lake level rose rapidly to the Holocene level. Changes in water level are likely linked to climate variability. During relatively temperate periods the lake becomes free of ice in summer. Strong wave actions transport sediment parallel to the coast and towards the outlet, where the material tends to accumulate, resulting in lake level rise. During cold periods the perennial lake ice cover hampers any wave activity and pebble-transport, keeping the outlet open and causing the lake level to drop. (C) 2011 University of Washington.

A stratigraphical constraint cluster analysis showed 7 biozones and 13 sub-biozones within the chironomid biostratigraphy. Characteristic taxa were allocated to each of the 7 biozones by simple analysis of the relative abundance diagram whereas several Correspondence Analyses (C.A.) were needed for the remaining 13 sub-biozones. Characteristic taxon compositions were interpreted using available quantitative inference models for total phosphorus concentration ([T.P.]), chlorophyll-a concentration ([Chl-a]), hypolimnetic oxygen conditions, and water temperature. Optimum ranks of the characteristic taxa against the environmental factors provided by these inference models were used to deduce an evaluation of environmental conditions. Paleoenvironmental interpretations of chironomid assemblage changes showed the Lateglacial climatic event succession (Oldest Dryas, Bolling/Allerod Interstadial, and Younger Dryas) commonly recognized in the area. Moreover, a bipartition of the Oldest Dryas, the occurrence of two minor oscillations during the Bolling/Allerod Interstadial and a trend in environmental changes (climatic improvement) during the Younger Dryas were also found.

J	Stelbrink, B; Wilke, T; Albrecht, C				Stelbrink, Bjorn; Wilke, Thomas; Albrecht, Christian			Ecological opportunity enabled invertebrate radiations in ancient Lake Ohrid	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Ancient Lake Ohrid is the oldest and biologically most diverse freshwater lake in Europe. The recent deep-drilling campaign SCOPSCO provided detailed insights into the lake's limnological history over the past 1.36 my. However, it remains unclear what factors triggered the onset of radiations and whether diversification rates remained constant throughout their evolution. We therefore inferred time-calibrated molecular phylogenies for eight invertebrate groups endemic to Lake Ohrid and performed diversification-rate analyses for the four most species-rich groups. The molecular-clock analyses indicate that few groups possibly originated in springs or rivers in the 'proto-Balkans' during the pre-lake phase. The onset of all other radiations, however, can be correlated to one of the three limnological phases in the Ohrid Graben and in Lake Ohrid since 1.9 mya. We therefore assume that the onset of radiations was triggered by an increased ecological opportunity arising from massive environmental changes in the course of the lake deepening. The diversification-rate analyses further indicate that the groups examined diversified with a constant rate. Although the reconstruction of the early evolutionary history of these groups remains challenging, our data suggest that the relatively stable conditions in Lake Ohrid together with its high buffer capacity likely prevented significant changes in diversification rates over time.

In order to depict the effect of the circulations induced by surface anomaly heating (patches) on the boundary-layer turbulence, the UK Met Office Large Eddy Model was used to produce a set of 1D strip-like surface heat flux distributions based on observations, which were obtained by a field campaign in the Ngoring Lake basin in the summer of 2012. The simulations show that for the cases without background wind, patch-induced circulations (SCs) promote the growth of convective boundary layer (CBL), enhance the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE), and then modify the spatial distribution of TKE. Based on phase-averaged analysis, which separates the attribution from the SCs and the background turbulence, the SCs contribute no more than 10 % to the vertical turbulent intensity, but their contributions to the heat flux can be up to 80 %. The thermal internal boundary layer (TIBL) reduces the wind speed and forms the stable stratification, which produces the obvious change of turbulent momentum flux and heat flux over the heterogeneous surfaces. The increased downdrafts, which mainly occur over the lake patches, carry more warm, dry air down from the free atmosphere. The background wind inhibits the SCs and the development of the CBL; it also weakens the patch-induced turbulent intensity, heat flux, and convective intensity.

The Silver Lake region in the Mojave Desert hosts several different rock types (talc, marble, quartz, white carbonate and red-coated carbonate) colonized by hypoliths within a few kilometres. This provides an opportunity to investigate the effect of rock type on hypolithic colonization in a given environment. Transmission measurements from 300 to 800 nm showed that the transmission of blue and UVA varied between rock types. The wavelength at which the transmission fell to 1% of the transmission at 600 nm was 475 nm for white carbonate and quartz, 425 nm for red- coated carbonate and talc and 380 nm for marble. The comparative analysis of the cyanobacterial component of hypoliths under different rocks, as revealed by sequencing 16S rRNA gene clone libraries, showed no significant variation with rock type; hypoliths were dominated by phylotypes of the genus Chroococcidiopsis, although less abundant phylotypes of the genus Loriellopsis, Leptolyngbya and Scytonema occurred. The comparison of the confocal laser scanning microscopy-lambda (CLSM-lambda) scan analysis of the spectral emission of the photosynthetic pigments of Chroococcidiopsis in different rocks with the spectrum of isolated Chroococcidiopsis sp. 029, revealed a 10 nm red shift in the emission fingerprinting for quartz and carbonate and a 5 nm red shift for talc samples. This result reflects the versatility of Chroococcidiopsis in inhabiting dry niches with different light availability for photosynthesis.					; Baqué, Mickael/AAC-8933-2019; Billi, Daniela/AAT-6690-2021	McKay, Christopher/0000-0002-6243-1362; BILLI, DANIELA/0000-0002-9363-2415; Baque, Mickael/0000-0002-6696-6030; Lloyd, Christopher/0000-0002-4479-0740; 													1473-5504	1475-3006				JUL	2014	13	3					271	277		10.1017/S1473550414000056	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1473550414000056													WOS:000337760300007

These time-critical events require low-latency detection. Previous work has shown that capture latency, defined as the duration between an event occurrence and a satellite capturing an image covering the event region, is the major latency component. In this work, we ask what the minimum capture latency is under physical orbital dynamics and energy constraints. We first characterize how region location and satellite orbital configuration affect the capture latency. Next, we explore the scheduling of satellite captures when energy constraints prevent the capture of all images. We introduce Geoduck, a satellite capture scheduler specifically designed to minimize capture latency. Geoduck leverages the insight that the timing of many events follows a prior distribution; for example, forest fires are more likely to occur in summer. We analyze the impact of different capture schedules on latency and propose a dynamic programming algorithm to choose the optimal captures. Our evaluation shows that Geoduck reduces capture latency by 1.5-2.1x.																					979-8-4007-1479-5				2025							547	559		10.1145/3715014.3722080	http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3715014.3722080													WOS:001502594900043

Here we report on cladoceran and diatom analyses of this freshwater deposit from three samples of detritus gyttja, which occurred beneath a thin cover of till and glaciofluvial deposits. The cladoceran fauna comprises many non-Greenlandic, non-Arctic taxa, in accordance with previous studies of Coleoptera, Trichoptera and vascular plants. The fossil assemblages from the Pingorsuit beds resemble other fossil assemblages from Greenland that have been assigned an Early Pleistocene age, and a similar age has been suggested for the sediments found at the margin of the Pingorsuit Glacier. The fossil cladoceran and diatom species indicate a shallow lake with oligo- and dystrophic, circumneutral to slightly acidic waters. Their assemblages are more diverse compared to Holocene assemblages from northern Greenland, further indicating warmer summers than present.

J	HICKS, DM; MCSAVENEY, MJ; CHINN, TJH				HICKS, DM; MCSAVENEY, MJ; CHINN, TJH			SEDIMENTATION IN PROGLACIAL IVORY LAKE, SOUTHERN ALPS, NEW-ZEALAND	ARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												Ivory Lake lies in a 2.2-km2 glacierized cirque basin cut in fissile schist in the western Southern Alps of New Zealand, a region of extremely high rainfall and erosion. Mean annual precipitation at Ivory Basin is 9200 mm, with 75% falling as rain during frequent, mainly high-intensity storms. The proglacial lake, formed by recessation of Ivory Glacier since 1953, traps at least 95% of the basin sediment yield. Bathymetric surveys of the lake were conducted over a 10-yr period (1976-1986) to determine sedimentation rates. Mean annual sediment supply to the lake is 31,000 t, i.e., an average erosion rate of 14,900 t km-2 a-1 from the area of the basin not occupied by the lake. About 60% of the sediment delivered to the lake originates from the steep basin wall, the remainder is probably eroded from the rock beneath the glacier. The sediment yield does not appear to be influenced by the extent of glacial cover. For basins of the Southern Alps cut in schist, annual sediment yield correlates well with annual precipitation or alternatively with annual runoff. Within an international dataset of glacierized and unglacierized basins, precipitation causes greater variation in sediment yield than does degree of glacial cover.																			0004-0851					FEB	1990	22	1					26	42		10.2307/1551718	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1551718													WOS:A1990CQ32100003

The volcano is known to have had repeated phreatic eruptions in last 200 years. A number of geochemical and geophysical studies have been conducted around the Yugama crater lake, the focus of current volcanic activity. However, the 2018 unexpected phreatic eruption occurred at Mt. Motoshirane, a different pyroclastic cone from that which hosts Yugama. There were also frequent magmatic eruptions until 1500 years ago at this cone and the magma produced at that time has not yet cooled and solidified. A better understanding of the magmatic hydrothermal system of this volcano requires structural information gathered over a larger area, and to greater depths, than has been achieved to date. Here, we describe the three-dimensional (3-D) electrical resistivity structure around Mt. Motoshirane down to a depth of -10 km using broadband magnetotelluric (MT) data (320-0.0005 Hz) collected in 2015 and 2016. The 3-D resistivity structure model shows an extensive low-resistivity layer at depths of 1-3.5 km beneath the summit. However, structures characteristic of the presence of magma are not observed beneath this layer. It could be too deep or too small to be detected. Combining the new data with results of previous geochemical and geophysical studies, we interpret the conductor as a hydrothermal fluid reservoir that supplies fluids to the crater lake and to hot springs on the eastern and western flanks of the volcano. The existence of a fluid reservoir that extends from the vicinity of the Yugama crater lake to the subsurface beneath an inactive pyroclastic cone that has produced repeated magmatic eruptions in the past suggests that a large-scale magmatic hydrothermal system is developing beneath the volcano.

These were compared to results from hunter-killed caribou from reference sites (Barrow and Teshekpuk Lake, Alaska) and from the area of a mine (Red Dog Mine) to determine whether heavy metals had played a role in the mortality event or whether any elements were at concentrations of concern for human consumers. Starvation and malnutrition were major factors leading to death or severe weakness, as very little or no fat (very low body condition scores) and serous atrophy of fat (observed as watery contents of the marrow cavity, with no apparent fat, and histologically) were more prevalent in caribou associated with the mortality event than in hunter-killed animals from reference sites. Accumulation of hepatic (liver) hemosiderin in Kupffer cells (macrophages) was noted as an indicator of cachexia. Concentrations of lead in feces and liver, copper in the rumen contents, and arsenic in muscle were higher in caribou harvested near Red Dog Mine, as might be expected in that mineral-rich area, but were not at levels of concern for toxicoses. Kidney concentrations of cadmium, which increased significantly with increasing age, present a potential concern for human consumers, and this is an expected finding. We concluded that caribou had starved and that heavy metals had played no role in the mortality event. Further investigation of regional mineral differences is required to understand the sources and transport mechanisms that explain these findings and to properly address mining activity. Mortality events on the north slope of Alaska are common and likely involve starvation as described here, but in most cases they are not investigated, even though recent industrial activities have heightened concern among some local residents and wildlife managers.																			0004-0843					JUN	2003	56	2					125	135		10.14430/arctic608	http://dx.doi.org/10.14430/arctic608													WOS:000183868100002

Ryan			Forewing pigmentation predicts migration distance in wild-caught migratory monarch butterflies	BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY												Surprisingly, little is known about how the environment influences the production of the iconic orange coloration of the monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus). Previous research under controlled laboratory conditions has shown that the temperature during larval development influences the color of monarch wings, where females raised in warm conditions had a greater proportion of melanization, whereas males raised in warm conditions had a lower proportion of melanization. These melanin-based colors have been found to increase flying ability in Lepidoptera, and recent experiments have found that monarchs with redder forewings flew greater distances than monarchs with less intense coloration. We examined whether wild-caught monarchs captured in the Great Lakes region exhibited geographic polyphenism by using stable isotopes to estimate natal origin, and hence rearing temperature, spectrophotometry to measure forewing coloration, and image analysis to estimate shape. We found that monarchs from the Gulf Coast were more melanized than monarchs from the Great Lakes, and southern male monarchs were more saturated than northern male monarchs. This supports previous research suggesting that colors that absorb more solar energy allow for greater flying ability but contradicts the patterns we expected based on natal temperature. Interestingly, this effect of color on migration distance was independent of wing shape. We provide the first evidence that the coloration of wild monarchs influences their migration ability over a continental scale, and we suggest that these differences in color may benefit the cohort of monarchs destined for long-distance migration to their wintering ground.

The early Holocene optimum inferred from a high-resolution pollen record of Huguangyan Maar Lake in southern China	CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN												A high-resolution pollen record of the past 13000 a from Huguangyan Maar Lake reveals the vegetation and environment changes in southern China during the Holocene. It shows that (i) pollen percentage of trees and shrubs reached 56% during the early Holocene (11600-7800 cal a BP), of which the pollen percentage of tropical trees reached a maximum at 9500-8000 cal a BP, reflecting a hot and wet environment; (ii) during the mid-Holocene (7800-4200 cal a BP), the pollen percentage of montane coniferous trees and herbs increased, while the percentage of tropical-subtropical trees decreased, indicating lower temperature and humidity; (iii) in the late Holocene spanning from 4200 to 350 cal a BP, the pollen percentage of herbs and montane conifer increased significantly, indicating a marked decrease of temperature and humidity. Our pollen data reveal that the time period 9500-8000 cal a BP in southern China represents a climatic optimum for the Holocene characterized by hot and wet conditions. This is consistent with the Holocene optimum found in lower latitude regions globally. We speculate that strong insolation might cause the northward migration of the ITCZ and subtropical summer monsoon front, which resulted in an early Holocene optimum in the Huguangyan area. The dry tendency and climate fluctuations of the middle and late Holocene could be associated with a decrease in solar insolation and frequent ENSO event.

Its study allows one to understand the roots of the processes that occur at the water-mass, water-atmosphere and water-sediment interfaces. The analysis of the Thomas Pond in the Brenne region gives a valuable overview of energy stock evolution on a yearly scale. It highlights the direct impact of this evolution on thermal stratification and the potential for evaporation and exchange with the atmosphere. The study of evaporation remains challenging due to the complexity of the energy processes and factors involved. Its estimation using formulas, which are mostly empirical, is one of the most used means for studying the process. The studied pond shows a natural stratification during the summer season, however often fragile and disturbed by other climatic factors such as wind and precipitation. This disruption leads to increased exchanges between the pond and the atmosphere. The methods used to estimate pond-atmosphere exchanges, namely evaporation, vary in values ranging between 1 mm/d to > 15 mm/d. Among these methods, three stand out and seem to give reasonable values. This observation is based on the noticeable drop of the pond's water level during the period of non-communication with the outside, which corresponds to 65 mm. The energy required for this evaporation varies between 600 W/m(2) and 1500 W/m(2), except for the Smith model, that slightly overestimates this parameter. The regulation of ponds' water volumes by managers, the increased duration of bungs closure and the intermittence of precipitations in recent years exacerbate the reduction of direct inputs to ponds and the aggravates the impacts of a changing climate. Under the effect of increasing air temperatures, losses by evaporation will also increase significantly. If we generalise the results obtained to all of the Brenne Park water bodies (4500 ponds of the park), losses by evaporation will lead to a significant water deficit of the Loire basin. From this study, the use of deep learning ensemble models was found to provide better short-term predictions (RMSE between 0.003 and 0.006 for all methods), thus confirming the effectiveness of these methods for similar applications.					; Nedjai, Rachid/AAK-2824-2020	bensaid, abdelkrim/0000-0002-7616-6184; ABDELHAMID, AZAROUAL/0000-0001-5453-8402; rachid, Nedjai/0000-0003-0376-4914														2073-4441				MAR	2022	14	6							923	10.3390/w14060923	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w14060923													WOS:000774279700001

We present a new sedimentary core record indicating orbital-scale dynamics of droughts that occurred in central-northern Mexico during the late Quaternary. This record is reconstructed from abundances of authigenic carbonate and windblown clastic sediments in a 1026-cm-long sediment core from the Santiaguillo ephemeral lake. The Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 2 lacked drought, and at least two different droughts were centred at c. 13.5ka and at c. 7ka during the MIS 1. The drought of c. 13.5ka in the Santiaguillo ephemeral lake was contemporary to an interval of droughts in the Basin of Mexico (central Mexico) and stronger aeolian activity in the Baja California peninsula (northwestern Mexico). This synchronous arid condition, observed in the subtropical as well as tropical Mexico, occurred during an interval of higher spring insolation, relatively warmer but fluctuating global temperature, and stronger El Nino-Southern Oscillation. Unsuccessful radiocarbon dating for the lower part of the sediment core led to an assignment of uncertain chronology to droughts that occurred possibly between MIS 5 and MIS 3.

J	McManus, J; Heinen, EA; Baehr, MM				McManus, J; Heinen, EA; Baehr, MM			Hypolimnetic oxidation rates in Lake Superior: Role of dissolved organic material on the lake's carbon budget	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												On average, the water column of Lake Superior is undersaturated with respect to dissolved oxygen and supersaturated with respect to carbon dioxide during the summer-stratified period. On the basis of temporal changes in water column dissolved oxygen, we calculate rates of oxygen consumption that range from 0.19 to 0.75 mmol m(-1) d(-1). These rates are a factor of 5-10 times larger than can be supported by the particulate carbon settling rates and benthic oxygen consumption rates. In addition, on the basis of the limited information available, dissolved allochthonous carbon inputs are insufficient to account for the calculated rates of carbon oxidation. Rates of nitrate and total CO2 (SigmaCO(2)) production are 0.019 +/- 0.012 and 0.13 +/- 0.06 mmol m(-3) d(-1), respectively, and are consistent with the oxidation of a dissolved organic component that is similar in composition (C: N ratio) to the settling particulate material. Previously published estimates of total primary production were smaller but similar in magnitude to our integrated water column respiration rates. We interpret the observed imbalance between particulate carbon delivered to the deep lake and the calculated rate of carbon oxidation to be the result of the decomposition of dissolved organic carbon that appears to have both an autochthonous and an allochthonous component.																			0024-3590					JUL	2003	48	4					1624	1632		10.4319/lo.2003.48.4.1624	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2003.48.4.1624													WOS:000184247900026

Diatom assemblages are dominated by Cyclotella distinguenda, Aulacoseira species, and small fragilarioid taxa, all of which are sensitive to changes in water pH and light conditions that are probably related to vegetation development and runoff processes triggered by variations in the Asian monsoon. High abundances of C. distinguenda and Pseudostaurosira brevistriata reflected cold and dry climates during the Late Glacial (12.2-11.4kyrBP). In the early Holocene (11.4-9.4kyrBP), a steep decline in C. distinguenda and a visible increase in Aulacoseira alpigena responded to a strengthening monsoon intensity. The persistent increases in A. alpigena mirrored strong monsoon intensity in the middle Holocene (9.4-4.6kyrBP). After 4.6kyrBP, the reduction of A. alpigena was related to weak monsoon intensity in the late Holocene. The main trends of diatom evolution show a general correspondence to variations in solar insolation. Three visible excursions, with an increase in P. brevistriata and a drop in A. alpigena, centered at around 8.4, 2.5, and 0.3kyrBP, correlate with low sunspot numbers and known cold events in the North Atlantic. Some similarities and correlations between the Holocene diatom data, the North Atlantic record, and solar insolation indicate that variations in the Asian monsoon response to changes in solar forcing and the North Atlantic climate.

Point bar deposits and ox-bow lakes are the products of lateral bend migration and meander cutoff. The present study focuses on identifying the meanders of River Manu and their cutoffs. Moreover, this study compares the temporal evolution and predicts the progress of selected meanders of River Manu. In the present research, the Survey of India topographical map, satellite imagery, and geographic information system (GIS) technique were used to examine the evolution of the Manu River meander. Subsequently, a field visit was done to the selected cutoffs and meanders of River Manu to ascertain the present status and collect data. It has been observed that many cutoffs have undergone temporal changes, and their sizes have decreased. Some have become dried or converted to agricultural fields. The width of River Manu has decreased in all the selected bends from 1932 to 2017. The sinuosity index has changed from 2.04 (1932) to 1.90 (2017), and the length of the river has decreased by 7 km in 85 years (1932-2017). The decrease in length is evident from lowering the number of meanders. Uniformity coefficient and coefficient of curvature of the bank soil samples were calculated, indicating that the soil is poorly graded and falls under the cohesionless category. Based on cross-section analysis, sediment discharge, grain-size analysis of the bank material, channel planform change, and radius of curvature, it can be stated that almost all the selected bends have the probability of future cutoff. The highest probabilities were observed in bend 3 (Jalai) and bend 4 (Chhontail). This work is aimed to provide planners with decisions regarding the construction of roads and bridges in areas that show the huge dynamicity of river meandering.

Calcite-rich lake marl taken from a natural deposit in the littoral zone was spread over the lake surface in order to co-precipitate phosphorus and cyanobacteria as well as to cover the sediment surface. The aim of this measure was to reduce the release of phosphorus from the nutrient-rich sediments into the water column under the anoxic conditions which prevail during periods of stratification. Monitoring the dispersion, transport and sedimentation of the lake marl in the water column was carried out using the in-situ multi-sensor system MINIBAT as well as by limnological studies and sediment core observations. During summer stagnation of the lake waters, suspended fine-grained calcite up to 15 mu m was found at the thermocline whereas the coarser particles sedimented immediately. Following the application of the lake mart, bottom sediments were covered by a 20-120-mm calcareous layer. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

However, first-year survival of stocked fingerlings is often low. To enhance stocking success of striped bass, a better understanding is needed on the impacts of different stocking strategies on early life-history dynamics. In this review paper, we first examined the existing literature on the role of abiotic and biotic factors on recruitment dynamics of stocked piscivores in inland freshwater systems. Second, we compiled the results of a progressive series of studies that were completed over a 25-year period in Smith Mountain Lake, Virginia, that focused on understanding the relationship between striped bass stocking success and biotic interactions, forage-fish prey availability and dynamics, and first-year recruitment. This case study demonstrated that differential intra-cohort growth and poor first-year winter survival are the primary factors limiting stocking success and that stocking fingerlings at a greater number of sites throughout the lake at lower densities improved recruitment to age 1. With this information, we provide stocking size, time, density, and location strategy recommendations that should yield increased survival and stocking success of striped bass in freshwater impoundments.

J	Morison, MQ; Macrae, ML; Petrone, RM; Fishback, L				Morison, Matthew Q.; Macrae, Merrin L.; Petrone, Richard M.; Fishback, LeeAnn			Capturing temporal and spatial variability in the chemistry of shallow permafrost ponds	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Across the circumpolar north, the fate of small freshwater ponds and lakes (< 1 km(2)) has been the subject of scientific interest due to their ubiquity in the landscape, capacity to exchange carbon and energy with the atmosphere, and their potential to inform researchers about past climates through sediment records. A changing climate has implications for the capacity of ponds and lakes to support organisms and store carbon, which in turn has important feedbacks to climate change. Thus, an improved understanding of pond biogeochemistry is needed. To characterize spatial and temporal patterns in water column chemistry, a suite of tundra ponds were examined to answer the following research questions: (1) does temporal variability exceed spatial variability? (2) If temporal variability exists, do all ponds (or groups of ponds) behave in a similar temporal pattern, linked to seasonal hydrologic drivers or precipitation events? Six shallow ponds located in the Hudson Bay Lowlands region were monitored between May and October 2015 (inclusive, spanning the entire open-water period). The ponds span a range of biophysical conditions including pond area, perimeter, depth, and shoreline development. Water samples were collected regularly, both bimonthly over the ice-free season and intensively during and following a large summer storm event. Samples were analysed for nitrogen speciation (NO3-, NH4+, dissolved organic nitrogen) and major ions (Cl-, SO42-, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+). Across all ponds, temporal variability (across the season and within a single rain event) exceeded spatial variability (variation among ponds) in concentrations of several major species (Cl-, SO42+, K+, Ca2+, Na+). Evapoconcentration and dilution of pond water with precipitation and runoff inputs were the dominant processes influencing a set of chemical species which are hydrologically driven (Cl-, Na+, K+, Mg2+, dissolved organic nitrogen), whereas the dissolved inorganic nitrogen species were likely mediated by processes within ponds. This work demonstrates the importance of understanding hydrologically driven chemodynamics in permafrost ponds on multiple scales (seasonal and event scale).

J	Assani, AA				Assani, Ali Arkamose			Analysis of the Impacts of Man-Made Features on the Stationarity and Dependence of Monthly Mean Maximum and Minimum Water Levels in the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence River of North America	WATER												Various manmade features (diversions, dredging, regulation, etc.) have affected water levels in the Great Lakes and their outlets since the 19th century. The goal of this study is to analyze the impacts of such features on the stationarity and dependence between monthly mean maximum and minimum water levels in the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence River from 1919 to 2012. As far as stationarity is concerned, the Lombard method brought out shifts in mean and variance values of monthly mean water levels in Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence River related to regulation of these waterbodies in the wake of the digging of the St. Lawrence Seaway in the mid-1950s. Water level shifts in the other lakes are linked to climate variability. As for the dependence between water levels, the copula method revealed a change in dependence mainly between Lakes Erie and Ontario following regulation of monthly mean maximum and minimum water levels in the latter. The impacts of manmade features primarily affected the temporal variability of monthly mean water levels in Lake Ontario.

Laird			Sulfur isotopes link overwinter habitat use and breeding condition in double-crested cormorants	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												North American Double-crested Cormorant (Phalacrocorax auritus) populations have increased greatly. Both breeding and overwintering ground factors have likely contributed to these increases. However, demonstrating how overwintering conditions may affect breeding birds has not been possible because of the difficulty in linking breeding birds to their wintering grounds. Here, we demonstrate the utility of stable sulfur isotopes to elucidate overwintering habitat use by cormorants breeding on Lake Erie. Sulfur isotopes in feathers grown on overwintering grounds provided insights into the degree to which birds used freshwater vs. marine environments. The proportion of birds utilizing freshwater habitats increased through time. This change may have reflected increases in freshwater aquaculture (i.e., catfish) in the U. S. south. Examination of body condition in birds returning to breed on Lake Erie indicated that those individuals that solely used marine habitats for at least a portion of the overwintering period were in poorer condition than birds using freshwater. Enhanced foraging opportunities at aquaculture facilities may improve the fitness of individuals that have returned to breed after overwintering at such locations. This study is the first to demonstrate a linkage between overwinter habitat use and breeding ground parameters in Double-crested Cormorants. These results underscore that factors throughout the Mississippi flyway are likely acting together to regulate cormorant populations.																			1051-0761	1939-5582				APR	2008	18	3					561	567		10.1890/07-1278.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/07-1278.1								18488616					WOS:000255437500001

Precipitation patterns and variability in Tropical Americas during the Holocene	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												The Tropical Americas (TA) have monsoons as the dominant feature of their hydroclimate. Precipitation in this region is influenced by the American Monsoon System (AMS). Throughout the Holocene, several global climate changes occurred that modified precipitation patterns in this region. Here we identify a general trend of increasing precipitation in the TA over the last 11,700 years. We analyzed different precipitation datasets, as paleorecords from lake sediments and speleothems, and Transient Climate Simulation of the Last 21,000 Years (TraCE-21ka) model results. We also identified occasional shifts in the TA's precipitation during the Holocene, with variations in the pattern of precipitation anomalies around 9,000 to 8,000 years, corroborated by highenergy wavelet analysis signals detected before 7,710 years. These results show that TA's precipitation was influenced by the final collapse of the North American ice sheets, accelerated by increased summer insolation in Northern Hemisphere (NH).

Eolian deposition in the alpine zone of the Uinta Mountains, Utah, USA	CATENA												Field and laboratory investigations were conducted to determine the origin of a ubiquitous layer of silt that caps soil profiles in the alpine zone of the Uinta Mountains, Utah, USA. Fine sediment isolated from snowbanks was studied to constrain the fraction of this material derived from allochthonous eolian additions. Lake sediments representing deposition over the past few centuries were analyzed to determine whether dust deposition in the Uintas has been a long-term process, and if properties of the modern dust differ from dust which accumulated prior to European settlement. Results indicate that alpine soils have been strongly influenced by long-term eolian deposition. The loess cap in these soil profiles averages 18 cm thick, and physical and chemical properties of soil horizons derived from the eolian parent material are significantly different than those of the subsurface horizons derived from in situ produced congelifractate. Fine sediment observed at the surface of snowbanks in the early summer is a mixture of silty exotic eolian material and sandy locally derived sediment. Snowbanks on ridgecrests and on slopes of blocky scree tend to accumulate the maximum amount of exotic dust with the minimum amount of local material. The grain-size distribution, mineralogy, and geochemistry of lake sediments indicate that dust has been accumulating in the Uintas for at least the last few centuries. Modern lake sediments are significantly enriched in elements indicative of upwind mining and agricultural activity, recording an anthropogenic change in dust composition following settlement of the surrounding lowland basins.

Studies of phylogenetic relationships between palearctic and nearctic burbot have demonstrated the presence of distinct groups between North American and European populations. Higher resolution separation within western North American populations has thus far not been undertaken. In this study, we examined 372 burbot collected from 28 sample locations across its range in western North America. A 572 base pair portion of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene was used to estimate diversity and divergence among populations and further characterize matrilineal lines. Three distinct haplogroups of burbot were observed that correspond to past allopatric distributions within Pleistocene refugia, namely the Pacific, Mississippi, and Missouri. Within the Columbia/Kootenai River basins west of the Continental Divide, admixtures of Pacific and Mississippi matrilines are indicative of both postglacial expansion and sorting as well as clinal variation resulting from vicariant events as seen in the Kootenai River population below Kootenai Falls. The study was also designed to help determine which northwest population would be most suitable in genetic terms as a donor stock to rehabilitate the Kootenai River, Idaho population. Of eight haplotypes found in the Kootenai River, Idaho and Columbia Lake, British Columbia, six are shared.

Accordingly, we conducted short-term zooplankton grazing experiments in bottles with water from 12 Danish brackish lakes covering a large gradient in salinity (0.3-17.4 parts per thousand) and nutrient concentrations as well as with water from 24 mesocosms established in the same area with various salinities (0.5-12 parts per thousand), two nutrient levels and low fish density. Grazing was low in 11 of the 12 lakes, even when they were dominated by edible phytoplankton and nutrient addition led to a major increase in phytoplankton biomass. By contrast, grazing was significant in most of the mesocosms, particularly at high nutrient levels and salinities of 8 parts per thousand or below where Daphnia dominated. Moreover, grazing decreased the biomass of most phytoplankton taxa, except for a few (e.g. Ankyra at 0.5-2 parts per thousand and Ochromonas and Chaetoceros at 8 parts per thousand). Our results provide experimental support for potentially significant grazing by zooplankton on phytoplankton in brackish lakes up to a salinity of 8 parts per thousand at low fish density; however, grazing in summer was generally low in the majority of the lakes, which we attribute to high predation on zooplankton.					; Jeppesen, Erik/O-2667-2019; Amorim, Cihelio Alves/Q-5965-2017; Søndergaard, Martin/P-2417-2019; Lauridsen, Torben/JAX-3118-2023; Amorim, Cihelio/Q-5965-2017; Richardson, Katherine/D-7592-2014; Sondergaard, Martin/P-2417-2019; Jeppesen, Erik/A-4463-2012	Lauridsen, Torben/0000-0003-0139-2395; Pacheco Esnal, Juan Pablo/0000-0002-8100-2635; Amorim, Cihelio Alves/0000-0002-7171-7450; Pedersen, Lisbeth Kjaereby/0000-0001-9437-5636; Richardson, Katherine/0000-0003-3785-2787; , tserenpil/0000-0001-8139-4897; Sondergaard, Martin/0000-0002-1514-0482; Jeppesen, Erik/0000-0002-0542-369X													0018-8158	1573-5117				NOV	2023	850	20			SI		4609	4626		10.1007/s10750-022-05017-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-022-05017-1		OCT 2022											WOS:000874471900010

Remote Sensing of African Lakes: A Review	REMOTE SENSING OF THE AFRICAN SEAS												The optical complexity and small size of inland waters make the application of remote sensing more challenging than for the open ocean. However, in Africa, where in situ monitoring of important water bodies is financially, institutionally and spatially constrained, there is strong demand for remote sensing to fill the critical information gap. Here we review a wide range of applications of both passive and active remote sensing to African lakes. The applications fall into five main categories: (1) visible, NIR, thermal and microwave sensing of lake area; (2) altimetric and gravimetric sensing of lake level; (3) thermal sensing of lake surface temperature; (4) visible, NIR and microwave sensing of macrophytes; and (5) optical sensing of trophic conditions including chlorophyll-a and euphotic depth. Sensors used include Landsat MSS, TM and ETM+, MERIS, MODIS, SeaWiFS, AVHRR, Meteosat, TOPEX/Poseidon, Jason-1, OSTM/Jason-2, ERS-1, ERS-2, Envisat, GFO, ICESat, ALOS-PALSAR and GRACE. The majority of studies have been applied to the "great" lakes such as Chad, Malawi, Tanganyika and Victoria; however, there is a growing body of literature on smaller lakes. We examine the possibilities that remote sensing offers to monitoring and management of African lakes as well as the potential limitations of the technology using Lake Victoria as an illustrative case.					; Loiselle, Steven/ABA-3324-2020; Cozar, Andres/G-2141-2016	Bradt, Shane/0000-0003-2142-6732; Loiselle, Steven/0000-0001-7414-0389; OLAKA, LYDIA/0000-0002-5917-7586; 															978-94-017-8008-7; 978-94-017-8007-0				2014							403	422		10.1007/978-94-017-8008-7_20	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-94-017-8008-7_20	10.1007/978-94-017-8008-7												WOS:000362071100021

The vertical distribution and abundance of Gammarus lacustris in the pelagic zone of the meromictic lakes Shira and Shunet (Khakassia, Russia)	AQUATIC ECOLOGY												The vertical distribution and abundance of Gammarus lacustris in the pelagic zone of two fishless meromictic lakes, L. Shira and L. Shunet, in Southern Siberia (Russia), was studied with the underwater video recording system and using vertical hauls. In both lakes, during summer stratification, Gammarus was distributed non-homogenously, with a stable peak in the metalimnion. The average depth of Gammarus population in the pelagic zone was significantly correlated with the depth of the thermo-cline. Gammarus abundances obtained using vertical plankton hauls with net were quite comparable with those obtained from video records. The peak abundance of Gammarus in the pelagic zone of the lakes observed with underwater video amounted up to 400 individuals m(-2), while the peak animal densities in the metalimnion reached 50 ind. m(-3). The data are compared with previously published abundances of Gammarus in the littoral of Lake Shira. Both littoral and pelagic can be equally important habitats for amphipods in meromictic lakes. The absence of fish in the pelagic zone, high oxygen concentration, low water temperature, increased seston concentration, elevated water density in the metalimnion and the anoxic hypolimnion can be the most probable combination of factors that are responsible for the peak of Gammarus in the metalimnion of these lakes.					; Zadereev, Egor/J-2200-2012; Drobotov, Anton/I-8428-2018; Yemelyanova, Anna/R-9024-2016; Tolomeev, Aleksandr/I-9601-2018	Zadereev, Egor/0000-0003-2366-8604; Tolomeev, Aleksandr/0000-0002-9124-4566; Drobotov, Anton/0009-0007-1722-4958; Yemelyanova, Anna/0000-0002-5463-1305; 													1386-2588	1573-5125				SEP	2010	44	3					531	539		10.1007/s10452-010-9329-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10452-010-9329-5													WOS:000285338600006

Trophic ecology of nonanadromous rainbow trout in a post-glacial lake system: partial convergence of adfluvial and fluvial forms	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												The rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss (Walbaum, 1792)) is one of many salmonid species exhibiting a gradient of life histories including fluvial (stream-resident), anadromous (ocean-migrant), and adfluvial (lake-migrant) forms, the last of which is less extensively studied than the other two. Our goal was to determine the extent of diet segregation between fluvial and adfluvial rainbow trout. We collected stomach content and stable isotope data on rainbow trout sampled in stream and lake habitats in a southwestern Alaska watershed during summer and compared them with data on sympatric stream- and lake-specialist char species, Dolly Varden (Salvelinus maima (Walbaum in Artedi, 1792)) and Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus (Linnaeus, 1758)), respectively. Rainbow trout in streams fed largely on aquatic insects, while those in the lake ate primarily benthic snails and amphipods. The trophic segregation of stream-resident and lake-migrant rainbow trout mirrored but was less extreme than the divergence of lotic Dolly Varden and lentic Arctic char in the same system. Spawning sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka (Walbaum in Artedi, 1792)) provided a nutrient subsidy in the form of eggs that supported rainbow trout in both stream and lake (littoral) habitats, causing their isotopic signatures to converge. This study augments knowledge of partial migration and trophic divergence within populations.

Residue analyses indicated that although the theoretical concentration of 10 to 12 mu g l(-1) fluridone was not sustained for 13 weeks, hydrilla was susceptible to lower concentrations over the long exposure periods that resulted from low water discharges that occurred in 1990. The combined fluridone concentrations and exposure times at a given site were expressed in Fluridone Exposure Days (FEDs), and these values were related to water flow data, particularly the influence of spring-fed tributaries. Hydrilla was controlled for 10 to 12 months in the upstream half of the target area, where fluridone exposure was in excess of 500 FEDs, but in do downstream areas subject to 250 FEDs, hydrilla control lasted for only six to nine months. This treatment was repeated in 1991 under increased flow conditions, with only a 10-week application period. Effective weed control was achieved despite lower FEDs possibly because of the increased susceptibility of the actively growing plants and the stresses caused by high water levels.

Radar Refractivity Retrievals in Oklahoma: Insights into Operational Benefits and Limitations	WEATHER AND FORECASTING												The 2007 and 2008 spring refractivity experiments at KTLX investigated the potential utility of high-resolution, near-surface refractivity measurements to operational forecasting. During these experiments, forecasters at the Norman, Oklahoma, National Weather Service Forecast Office (NWSFO) assessed refractivity and scan-to-scan refractivity change fields retrieved from the Weather Surveillance Radar-1988 Doppler weather radar near Oklahoma City-Twin Lakes, Oklahoma (KTLX). Both quantitative and qualitative analysis methods were used to analyze the 41 responses from seven forecasters to a questionnaire designed to measure the impact of refractivity fields on forecast operations. The analysis revealed that forecasts benefited from the refractivity fields on 25% of the days included in the evaluation. In each of these cases, the refractivity fields provided complementary information that somewhat enhanced the forecasters' capability to analyze the near-surface environment and boosted their confidence in moisture trends. A case in point was the ability to track a retreating dryline after its location was obscured by a weak reflectivity bloom caused by biological scatterers. Forecasters unanimously agreed, however, that the impact of this complementary information on their forecasts was too insignificant to justify its addition as an operational dataset. The applicability of these findings to other NWSFOs may be limited to locations with similar weather situations and access to surface data networks like the Oklahoma Mesonet.					; Bodine, David/B-5023-2014; Palmer, Robert/C-4408-2013	Cheong, Boonleng/0000-0002-6746-717X; 													0882-8156					OCT	2009	24	5					1345	1361		10.1175/2009WAF2222256.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/2009WAF2222256.1													WOS:000271622700011

Depressions of pH are often smaller in systems with low pre-episode pH levels. Studies on European surface waters have reported episodes most frequently with minimum pH levels below 4.5. In Canada and the United States, studies have also reported a number of systems that have had minimum pH levels below 4.5. In all areas, change in water flowpath during hydrological events is a major determinant of episode characteristics. Episodic acidification is also controlled by a combination of other natural and anthropogenic factors. Base cation decreases are an important contributor to episodes in circumneutral streams and lakes. Sulphate pulses are generally important contributors to episodic acidification in Europe and Canada. Nitrate pulses are generally more important to episodic acidification in the Northeast United States. Increases in organic acids contribute to episodes in some streams in all areas. The sea-salt effect is important in near-coastal streams and lakes. In Canada, Europe and the United States, acidic deposition has increased the severity (minimum pH reached) of episodes in some streams and lakes.

Embryonic and post-embryonic development times and reproduction were determined in the laboratory at four temperatures (10, 15, 20 and 25 A degrees C) and under ad libitum food condition. Post-embryonic development time of E. japonicus from hatching to adult female decreased with increasing temperature from 67.9 to 15.1 days. Males reached the adult stage 1-6 days earlier than the females. Only 15 % of the individuals survived until the adult stage at 10 A degrees C, while 40 % did so at > 15 A degrees C. Egg production also depended on temperature. A power function of temperature on instantaneous growth rate predicted a value of < 0.06 day(-1) when water temperature was below 10 A degrees C, suggesting that E. japonicus retards its growth during winter. The null value obtained at 8.6 A degrees C for the computed population growth rate supports the idea of an overwintering strategy. Responses of life history traits to temperature suggested that in conditions where there was no food limitation, E. japonicus in Lake Biwa would be able to take advantage of the rise of temperature predicted in the context of global climate change.

However, C-14 reservoir correction always challenges the accuracy of the C-14 chronology of terrestrial and marine sediments and the uncertainty of the C-14 chronology associated with the carbon reservoir effect becomes critical for high resolution paleoclimate studies. Here, based on the hypothesis of synchronization of precipitation isotopes, we verify and identify a series of in-phase points of precipitation isotopes (IPPIs) between sediment leaf-wax hydrogen and stalagmite-calcite oxygen isotopes. Because stalagmite oxygen isotope records are accurately dated by U-Th dating technology, the ages of stalagmite IPPIs could be used to improve C-14 reservoir correction of lacustrine IPPIs. We found that reservoir-corrected C-14 ages of lacustrine, peat, and marine IPPIs are scattered with an average uncertainty of 1 ka when compared with the corresponding IPPIs on U-Th age scales. We suggest that the reservoir age correction at different time intervals could be further adjusted by using the U-Th age-backed IPPIs, which largely reduces the uncertainty of the C-14 chronology and thus provides more accurate paleoclimate records.

J	Hill, CL; Schild, R				Hill, Christopher L.; Schild, Romuald			PLEISTOCENE DEPOSITS IN THE SOUTHERN EGYPTIAN SAHARA: LITHOSTRATIGRAPHIC RELATIONSHIPS OF SEDIMENTS AND LANDSCAPE DYNAMICS AT BIR TARFAWI	STUDIA QUATERNARIA												The sedimentological and lithostratigraphic record from north-central Bir Tarfawi documents the presence of Pleistocene basin-fill deposits. Three topographic basins were created as a result of deflation during climate episodes associated with lowering of the local groundwater table. In each case, the three deflational basins or topographic depressions were subsequently filled with sediments; these basin aggradations coincided with changes from arid climate conditions to wetter conditions and a rise in the groundwater table. The oldest and highest sedimentary remnant is associated with Acheulian artifacts and may reflect spring-fed pond and marsh conditions during a Middle Pleistocene wet climate episode. Lithofacies for a lower stratigraphic sequence (the "White Lake") documents deposition in a perennial lake that varied in extent and depth and is associated with Middle Paleolithic artifacts. A third episode of deflation created a topographic low that has been filled with Late Pleistocene sediments that are associated with Middle Paleolithic artifacts and fossil remains. Lateral and vertical variations in the lithofacies of this basin-fill sequence and the sediments of the "grey-green" lake phases provide a record of changing hydrologic conditions. These hydrologic conditions appear to reflect variations in water-table levels related to groundwater recharge and, at times, local rains.																			1641-5558	2300-0384					2017	34	1					23	38		10.1515/squa-2017-0002	http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/squa-2017-0002													WOS:000414744500003

Water discharge, temperature and insolation, each with a different time lag, as well as substrates and nutrients were examined in order to explain macroalgal biomass variability. Twenty-four macroalgae genera were recorded with Spirogyra, Cladophora, Vaucheria and Oedogonium as abundant. Through redundancy analysis the macroalgal community composition exhibited significant differences, between the sampling sites and also from one year to the next. Water discharge (time-lag = 5 days) and temperature (time-lag = 20 days) both significantly explained macroalgal biomass variability, highlighting differences in the time lag of the macroalgal community's ecological response to environmental changes. Spatial segregation was observed within the wide riverbed due to habitat variability, allowing co-occurrence in the development of ecologically different taxa within each sampling site. The high nitrate concentrations as compared with the particular low phosphorus concentrations led to especially high DIN/SRP ratios (248 +/- 103, n = 18). The N/P ratios in algal tissues were high (25 +/- 16, n = 26) and indicated P-limitation. The differences in DIN/SRP and N/P ratios suggest additional nutrient sources than open water such as groundwater inputs. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Late Holocene Sedimentary Record from Chhari Dhandh, Kachchh, Western India	JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF INDIA												The Chhari Dhandh (lake), located at the periphery of Banni plains, is a lacustrine archive in the hyper arid regime of Kachchh in western India. In the present study, the geochemical proxy approach has been made to reconstruct the signals from the past climate conditions on the core retrieved from the Chhari lake, which is supported by the radiocarbon and optical dating methods. The research identifies five significant climatic events of alternate humid (warm) and dry (cold) climatic conditions spanning the last similar to 2400 cal yr BP. The signatures of the Roman Warm Period, Cold Dark Ages and Medieval Warm Period suggest the strong archiving potential of this landscape for past climatic signatures. The top part of the sedimentary record also reports climatic conditions resembling the global event of Little Ice Age, but this information is speculative due to a lack of chronological support. The study again highlights the Kachchh landscape as a robust and unique natural laboratory to assess climate and tectonic processes.

The 1912 earthquake in South Baikal: traces in bottom sediments and gas release into the water column	RUSSIAN GEOLOGY AND GEOPHYSICS												Large earthquakes took place in southern Cisbaikalia in the first half of 1912. They might have caused a mass release of gas (methane?) into the water column of Lake Baikal and the atmosphere near Sharyzhalgai station of the Circum-Baikal Railroad. This phenomenon was observed in August 1912 by the residents as rising water columns several meters high and reported in the regional press. To find traces of this event, core was recovered from bottom sediments at a depth of 1300 m in winter 2010. The depth interval 1-8.7 cm is a homogeneous layer, no more than 100 years old (Pb-210 dating). The sediments here are poor in SiO2biog but richer in C-org than the underlying sediments. Also, they are marked by a considerable content of terrestrial plant remains, a lower content of planktonic diatoms, and higher contents of benthic and ancient diatoms. These data indicate that the layer under study formed as a result of the 1912 earthquake, with a considerable contribution from the littoral and shallow-water zones of Lake Baikal. (C) 2012, V.S.

Due to current pollution problems, fish production in the lake greatly declined. Besides fish biology, this study considered a wide array of water databases in selected sites along the lake. Hydrologic and biologic data were compared to that of a reference fish hatchery. Water concentrations of ammonia, manganese, nickel, cadmium, lead and mercury proved hazardous to fish, whereas chromium, copper, iron, zinc, pH, alkalinity, hardness, phosphate, nitrate, and nitrite always fell within acceptable levels. Physiologic evaluation of O. niloticus pointed out improper growth, protein inadequacy, and functional impairment in fish inhabiting polluted sites, in particular the lake main basin. These were reflected by data of specific formulae as RNA/DNA and the relative RNA content (r) in cells of the liver and gill arches as well as by the relative mobilization of serum protein fractions. It seems, however, that growth competence is additionally affected by the stress impact exerted upon fish by massive population numbers in some cramped commercial ponds.					; Adham, Khadiga/K-5881-2018	Adham, Khadiga/0000-0003-2839-8965; 													0323-4320					JAN	2002	29	5					278	+																WOS:000173854200003
J	Zhang, ZF; Xia, SS; Sun, XT; Zhou, LZ				Zhang, Zhongfang; Xia, Shanshan; Sun, Xuetao; Zhou, Lizhi			Effects of Macrobenthos Relative to Floating-Leaved Plants on the Wintering Shorebird Assemblages at Shengjin Lake, China	DIVERSITY-BASEL												In shallow lakes, floating-leaved plants can produce dense lakebeds that dramatically alter freshwater ecosystems and impact macrobenthic communities. Shorebirds are morphologically diverse and utilize different foraging strategies; they can partition food resources to achieve coexistence due to differences in food availability. In this study, we defined shorebird foraging guilds using a principal component analysis and explained differences in shorebird composition in terms of food availability by comparing macrobenthic and shorebird communities in Euryale ferox artificial planting areas, Trapa spp. natural growth areas, and control areas. The Mantel test and a Spearman analysis were used to correlate macrobenthic taxa with shorebird foraging guilds. We recorded four different macrobenthic taxa in the three study areas, including insects, gastropods, oligochaetes, and bivalves. Fifteen species belonging to three shorebird families were recorded across the three study areas. Our results suggest that floating-leaved plants are an important cause of differences in macrobenthic communities, and epifaunal macrobenthos (insects and gastropods) and infaunal macrobenthos (oligochaetes and bivalves) take on different patterns of diversity composition in different habitats. The macrobenthic and shorebird communities were potentially coherent. Different shorebird foraging guilds were limited by food availability and thus correlated differently with different macrobenthos. Therefore, differences in macrobenthic communities relative to floating-leaved plants can affect shorebird assemblages by affecting the availability of food resources.

Phytoplankton biomass, dissolved organic matter, and temperature drive respiration in whole lake nutrient additions	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Lake respiration is supported by a mixture of autochthonous and allochthonous resources, but the relative significance and interaction of these sources are uncertain across gradients of primary production and organic matter inputs. We manipulated autochthonous resources by adding inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus to two lakes during three summers and monitored a third reference lake. Allochthonous resources were measured as fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM). In the reference and two experimental lakes, daily estimates of respiration were made from continuously deployed oxygen sensors. Daily mean values of temperature and FDOM were determined from high-frequency measurements along with daily measures of chlorophyll a, an index of phytoplankton biomass. We analyzed time series of respiration and tested models that used combinations of the independent variables chlorophyll, FDOM, and temperature. The best models included all three of the independent variables. Respiration increased twofold over the temperature range of 14.5-28.6 degrees C. Respiration increased in association with phytoplankton blooms caused by the nutrient additions, but did not track blooms closely, because of large day-to-day variability. Respiration varied positively with FDOM that was primarily allochthonous and differed among lakes and years. We did not detect an interaction between chlorophyll and FDOM despite the large number of observations and range of chlorophyll and FDOM. Hydrologic, climatic, and land use changes are altering temperature and inputs of nutrients and organic matter to lakes. Our results indicate that these changes may lead to linear responses in ecosystem processes like respiration for the wide range of inputs represented in this study.

Aquatic and palustre vegetation conveys 23 vegetation assemblages, five habitats of national interest, and three community habitats featuring a well-represented floristic (87 taxa) and cenotic structure. The amount of phytogeographic elements is conferred by Eurasian phytotaxa 50.7%, European and Central-European 5.7%, Nordic-Circumpolar 18.4% and Cosmopolitan 18.4%. Adventitious and Mediterranean elements comprise a scarce percentage, merely 1.1%. As regards vegetation diversity, there has as well been identified an ornithological fauna typical of the aquatic habitats existing within the study area. There were found 65 bird species, the majority being water birds (60%). From the water bird species, 63% are summer guests and nesting ones. The Great Cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo) is a prevailing species in the area, most of its individuals nesting in Morun Lake colony. The Great Crested Grebe (Podiceps cristatus), the Great White Pelican (Pelecanus onocrotalus) as well as all observed ducks are subdominant species. The conservation state of the flora and nesting birds within the study area enables a sustainable development.

These water bodies are classified as mountain type of water bodies according to the Bulgarian National Typology and are situated in two ecoregions, i.e. Ecoregion 7 (Eastern Balkans) and Ecoregion 12 (Pontic Province). Totally, 120 taxa have been identified. The macroinvertebrate communities were specific to lentic waters and were dominated by oligochaetes and chironomid larvae. Larvae of dragonflies, mayflies and caddisflies as well as aquatic beetles, freshwater gastropods and mussels were also present with great taxonomic diversity. The influence of the environmental factors on the formation of the macroinvertebrate communities in the studied lentic ecosystems was analysed.

J	Kobler, UG; Schmid, M				Kobler, Ulrike Gabriele; Schmid, Martin			Ensemble modelling of ice cover for a reservoir affected by pumped-storage operation and climate change	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Ensemble modelling was used to assess the robustness of projected impacts of pumped-storage (PS) operation and climate change on reservoir ice cover. To this end, three one-dimensional and a two-dimensional laterally averaged hydrodynamic model were set up. For the latter, the strength of the impacts with increasing distance from the dam was also investigated. Climate change effects were simulated by forcing the models with 150 years of synthetic meteorological time series created with a weather generator based on available air temperature scenarios for Switzerland. Future climate by the end of the 21(st) century was projected to shorten the ice-covered period by similar to 2 months and decrease ice thicknesses by similar to 13 cm. Under current climate conditions, the ice cover would already be affected by extended PS operation. For example, the average probability of ice coverage on a specific day was projected to decrease by similar to 13% for current climate and could further be reduced from similar to 45% to similar to 10% for future climate. Overall, the results of all models were consistent. Although the number of winters without ice cover was projected to increase for all one-dimensional models, studying individual segments of the two-dimensional model showed that the impact was pronounced for segments close to the PS intake/outlet. In summary, the reservoir's ice cover is expected to partially vanish with higher probability of open water conditions closer to the PS intake/outlet.					; Schmid, Martin/C-3953-2009	Kobler, Ulrike/0000-0003-4661-3876; Schmid, Martin/0000-0001-8699-5691													0885-6087	1099-1085				SEP 30	2019	33	20					2676	2690		10.1002/hyp.13519	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.13519		JUL 2019											WOS:000479331100001

Does Lake Erie still have sufficient oxythermal habitat for cisco Coregonus artedi?	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												In Lake Erie, cisco (Coregonus artedi) once supported one of the most valuable freshwater fisheries on earth, yet overfishing caused their eventual extirpation from the lake. With warming lake temperatures, some have questioned whether Lake Erie still contains suitable oxythermal conditions for cisco. Using published oxythermal thresholds for adult cisco (which have more stringent requirements than juveniles) and oxythermal profiles from Lake Erie, we sought to answer two questions critical to cisco restoration science. First, is cisco habitat still available during the most restrictive periods? Second, what is the distribution of cisco habitat during these times? Beta regression was used to determine that cisco habitat was most limited during the month of August, and that August of 2010 was the most restrictive period in the time series. We then used Empirical Bayesian Kriging (EBK) to map the spatial extent of cisco habitat during these times. EBK maps revealed large areas of summer refugia for cisco in Lake Erie, even during the least favorable periods. Most of the Central and East Basins contain suitable habitat during the average August, yet during August of 2010, suitable conditions were limited to the eastern edge of the Central Basin and the deep waters of the East Basin. These findings aligned well with historical accounts of cisco landings. While suitable oxythermal habitat still exists for cisco in Lake Erie, future restoration efforts, if attempted, will partially depend on: 1) better management of nutrient inputs, 2) the realization of future climate scenarios, and 3) the ability of cisco to adapt to a changing lake.

Seed oysters from each stock were deployed in September 2011 at 2 dermo-endemic sites, Dauphin Island and Sandy Bay, Alabama, using an adjustable longline system, and their survival and shell heights were monitored bimonthly. P. marinus infection intensity and condition index were measured at deployment and in March, July and September 2012. The OBOY stock showed lower mortality than the unselected stocks (Cedar Point, Perdido Pass, Calcasieu Lake) at Dauphin Island, and both Louisiana stocks had lower mortality than the Alabama stocks at Sandy Bay, a slightly more saline site. Mortality increased in summer, especially between July and September, concomitant with increasing P. marinus infection intensities at the higher temperatures and favorable salinities. At the higher salinity site, both Louisiana stocks had lower P. marinus infection intensities than the Perdido Pass stock, the stock with the highest percentage of oysters with moderate and heavy infection and cumulative mortality. The OBOY stock reached greater mean shell height than Calcasieu Lake and Perdido Pass stocks. Condition index of the oyster stocks decreased by more than half between March and July following expected spawning. Differences in stock performance highlight the importance of stock selection for aquaculture in dermo-endemic estuaries of the northern Gulf of Mexico.																			1869-215X	1869-7534					2017	9									10.3354/aei00222	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/aei00222													WOS:000401349000001
J	Bell, CM				Bell, C. Mike			Quaternary lacustrine braid deltas on Lake General Carrera in southern Chile	ANDEAN GEOLOGY												A series of Quaternary lacustrine braid deltas oil the shores of Lake General Carrera in southern Chile formed as a result of falls in lake level. Each delta comprises two components, the delta fan and the beach embayment, each in turn comprising an onshore subaerial and an offshore Subaqueous element. The delta fans have a classic Gilbert form with a braided delta top and a steeply inclined delta front. Adjacent to the fans are concave beach embayments that formed parallel with the deltas as they prograded into the lake. The delta sediments consist predominantly of matrix- and clast-supported gravels to a total composite thickness exceeding 400 in. The depositional environments are dominated by ephemeral river flooding and by storm-driven waves. Beach sediment is sorted, rounded, winnowed and transported alongshore by waves to fill the beach embayment with ridges of very well sorted and well-rounded gravel. A gently-dipping shoreface platform occurs up to 100 m offshore between the beach and the brink point. From the brink point, in water depth of about 8 m, sediment cascades down the steep delta front slope to form long foresets extending to the lake floor. The sedimentary successions therefore wedge in the opposite direction from those of tectonically controlled basin margins where fail growth keeps pace with basin subsidence.																			0718-7092					JAN	2009	36	1					51	65		10.4067/S0718-71062009000100005	http://dx.doi.org/10.4067/S0718-71062009000100005													WOS:000263305200004

These anaerobic enrichments, inoculated with sediments and brines, used formate, butyrate and peptone as electron donors and elemental sulfur as an electron acceptor 4 M total Na+ and at pH 9-10. According to 16S rRNA gene sequencing, the isolates fell into two distinct groups. A major group, comprising seven obligate alkaliphilic isolates from highly alkaline soda lakes, represents a new species-level branch within the genus Natronolimnobius (order Natrialbales), while a single moderately alkaliphilic isolate from the less alkaline Searles Lake forms a novel genus-level lineage within the order Haloferacales. The cells of the isolates are either flat rods or coccoid. They are facultative anaerobes using formate or H-2 (in the presence of acetate or yeast extract as carbon source), C-4-C-9 fatty acids or peptone (the major group) as electron donors and either sulfur or DMSO (the major group) as electron acceptors.

Prey remains representing 304 prey items were recovered from 192 individual snakes. Concho water snakes were almost completely piscivorous, feeding on 19 species of fish from nine families with minnows (Cyprinidae) dominating numerically. Cricket frogs (Acris crepitans) represented the only non-piscine prey. Diet diversity increased ontogenetically according to snake body size. Observations of foraging snakes suggest an ontogenetic change in foraging sites concurrent with a change in diet composition. Prey size was positively correlated with snake body size although some snakes occasionally ingested numerous small prey, possibly due to opportunistic feeding on small prey aggregations. Snakes occasionally attempted to handle prey too large to be ingested. Feeding occurred from mid-March to early November. Gravid females fed throughout the spring into mid-July and resumed feeding after parturition. Neonate and juvenile riverine snakes ingested prey in proportion to apparent availability while adults consumed a disproportionate amount of larger prey species. Lacustrine snakes primarily consumed prey associated with benthic or shallow water habitats. However, few individuals of open water and top water species were ingested, suggesting that prey habitat preference strongly influences catchability in lake systems.

Abiotic Factors and Their Role in Phytoplankton Development in Reservoirs of the Middle Volga River, Russia	INLAND WATER BIOLOGY												The interannual and long-term variability of abiotic characteristics and chlorophyll content is studied in reservoirs of the Middle Volga River by field observations in the summer period of 2015-2020. Water transparency increases from 1.2 +/- 0.1 m in the Gorky Reservoir to 1.5 +/- 0.1 m in the Kuibyshev Reservoir and electrical conductivity from 206 +/- 2 to 315 +/- 7 mu S/cm, respectively. Water color decreases from 53 +/- 1 to 38 +/- 1; all these features reflect the pronounced zoning of the Volga River cascade. The water temperature depends on local weather conditions. The concentration of P-tot increases from 68 & PLUSMN; 3 mu g/L in the Gorky Reservoir up to 145 & PLUSMN; 7 mu g/L in the Kuibyshev Reservoir; the concentration of N-tot (1.08 & PLUSMN; 0.05-1.14 +/- 0.06 mg/L) changes insignificantly. The content of Chl a averages 10.9 +/- 0.7, 26.7 +/- 3.9, and 9.2 +/- 1.0 mu g/L in the Gorky, Cheboksary, and Kuibyshev reservoirs, respectively; this parameter ranges widely and is characterized by interannual variability. The trophic status of the Gorky and Kuibyshev reservoirs in different years varies from mesotrophic to moderately eutrophic and eutrophic; the Cheboksary Reservoir is characterized as eutrophic throughout the entire 6-year period. The low correlation coefficients between the content of Chl a and abiotic characteristics indicates the complex and multicomponent influence of external conditions on the phytoplankton development.

Trapa japonica can live in a wide range of nutrient levels. This species forms an environment with a steeper extinction of light, higher concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), lower concentrations of dissolved oxygen (DO) near the bottom, and lower concentrations of nitrate + nitrite and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) than other vegetation types. The pH was much higher in a Polygonum amphibium community, and the DO near the bottom did not decrease compared to a T. japonica community in the summer. The relationship between chlorophyll a and the limiting nutrient (total phosphorus (TP) when total nitrogen (TN) : TP is greater than or equal to10 and TN/10 when TN : TP is <10) significantly differed between lakes with and without submerged vegetation. The chlorophyll a concentrations at a given nutrient level were significantly lower in water with submerged macrophytes than in water without them. Correspondence analysis showed that the difference in phytoplankton community structure across sites was largely due to the presence or absence of submerged macrophytes, and the ordination of phytoplankton species in the lakes with submerged macrophytes is best explained by environmental gradients of TN, chlorophyll, pH and SRP.																			0912-3814	1440-1703				JUL	2003	18	4					381	395		10.1046/j.1440-1703.2003.00563.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1440-1703.2003.00563.x													WOS:000183959600004

While it is a major water resource in the whole region, Lake Sevan has received little attention in international limnological literature. Although recent studies pointed to algal blooms and negative impacts of climate change and eutrophication, the physical controls on thermal dynamics have not been characterized and model-based assessments of climate change impacts are lacking. We compiled a decade of historical data for meteorological conditions and temperature dynamics in Lake Sevan and used a one-dimensional hydrodynamic model (GLM 3.1) in order to study thermal structure, the stratification phenology and their meteorological drivers in this large mountain lake. We then evaluated the representativeness of meteorological data products covering almost 4 decades (EWEMBI-dataset: 1979-2016) for driving the model and found that these data are well suited to restore long term thermal dynamics in Lake Sevan. This established model setting allowed us to identify major changes in Lake Sevan's stratification in response to changing meteorological conditions as expected from ongoing climate change. Our results point to a changing mixing type from dimictic to monomictic as Lake Sevan will experience prolonged summer stratification periods and more stable stratification. These projected changes in stratification must be included in long-term management perspectives as they will intensify water quality deteriorations like surface algal blooms or deep water anoxia.

Modeling the bottom temperature variation patterns on a coastal marine ecosystem of the Southwestern Atlantic Ocean (El Rincon), with special emphasis on thermal changes affecting fish populations	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS												The detailed knowledge of temperature variation patterns in marine ecosystems is important to understand marine communities' dynamics. The present study modeled the historical (1980-2016) daily bottom temperatures on a shallow marine ecosystem of the Southwestern Atlantic Ocean (El Rincon), which is a reproductive ground for several commercially important fish. A detailed description of bottom temperature variation patterns was performed mainly focusing on those changes influencing fish populations. The model used in the present study is a modification from previous models applied to lakes and tidal inlets, and predicts daily water temperatures from air temperatures and radiation, considering in turn the change of thermal inertia with depth. Bottom temperature data for model calibration, and also salinity, were recorded on 666 oceanographic stations between July 1993 and December 2012. More than 95% of daily bottom temperature variation was explained by the fitted model, and predictability decreased from 98 to 82% in relation to the increase in thermal inertia with depth. High model deviations (> 1.5 degrees C) were associated with a particular salinity range (33.6-33.9) and evidenced eventual occurrence of cold water advections more evident during the warm season. In response to the changes in thermal inertia with depth, the seasonal occurrence of two opposite horizontal thermal gradients was evident each year. These gradients involved a shoreward warming during the warm season, which promotes fish reproductive aggregations, and a shoreward cooling (warming toward deeper zones) during the cold season, which is related with adult fish dispersion or even migration. Up to more than one month of difference in the onset-end pattern of these thermal gradients was observed depending on the year. Long-term linear variation trends in temperature changed seasonally, with higher cooling rates during spring months, which was particularly evident during October. Also, irregular 3 to 7 year thermal oscillations appeared to occur, indicating the influence of one or more climate variability phenomena. These results depict the general dynamics of bottom temperature patterns in a shallow temperate marine ecosystem, with particular emphasis on their implications for understanding different aspects of fish populations. Particularly, the model and specific data provided in this study will help to further advance our knowledge of this marine ecosystem, in which fishes play an important economical role.

Steam-injection strategy and energetics of steam-assisted gravity drainage	SPE RESERVOIR EVALUATION & ENGINEERING					2005 SPE/PS-CIM/CHOA International Thermal Operations and Heavy Oil Symposium	NOV 01-03, 2005	Calgary, CANADA	Soc Petr Engineers, PS-CIM, CHOA				Steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) is being operated by several operators in Athabasca and Cold Lake reservoirs in Central and Northern Alberta, Canada. In this process, steam, injected into a horizontal well, flows outward, then contacts and loses its latent heat to bitumen at the edge of a depletion chamber. As a consequence, the viscosity of bitumen falls, its mobility rises, and it flows under gravity toward a horizontal production well located several meters below and parallel to the injection well. Despite many pilots and commercial operations, it remains unclear how to optimally operate SAGD. This is especially the case in reservoirs with a top-gas zone in which pilot data are nearly nonexistent. In this study, a steam-chamber operating strategy is determined that leads to optimum oil recovery for a minimum cumulative steam-to-oil ratio (SOR) in a top-gas reservoir. These findings were established from extensive reservoir-simulation runs that were based on a detailed geostatistically generated static reservoir model. The strategy devised uses a high initial chamber injection rate and pressure prior to chamber contact with the top gas. Subsequent to breakthrough of the chamber into the gas-cap zone, the chamber injection rates are lowered to balance pressures with the top gas and avoid (or at least minimize) convective heat losses of steam to the top-gas zone. The results are also analyzed by examining the energetics of SAGD.

Such studies require regional background information about hydrogen and oxygen isotope variability of takes and their potential inflows. Here, a stable isotope database (delta H-2 and delta O-18) is presented for estimating evaporation to inflow ratios (E/l) of takes in semi-arid southern Patagonia. Water samples of 23 takes and ponds located in the Patagonian steppe at about 52 degrees S were sampled during three subsequent austral summers. Two deep crater takes, Laguna Azut and Laguna Potrok Aike, were studied in more detail during a two-years monitoring. Furthermore, precipitation, groundwater and atmospheric water vapor were sampled for isotope analyses. Presented data imply that the isotopic composition of rainfall in southeastern Patagonia is predominantly determined by precipitation amount and moisture source area. For the investigated area, the first meteoric water and evaporation lines in delta H-2 vs. delta O-18 space are presented. The database was further used to estimate the water balances of the two crater takes, Laguna Azut and Laguna Potrok Aike, which are in the focus of recent pateoclimatic investigations. According to that approach about 50% and 60%, respectively, of the water entering Laguna Azut and Laguna Potrok Aike via surface and subsurface inflow evaporates. These results testify a considerable flow of take waters into the groundwater. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Twelve fish species were captured, of which four were native and eight exotic. Correspondence analysis revealed that spatial variation accounted for most of the variation (73.7%) in fish species composition. The upstream, urban area was dominated by chub (Leuciscus cephalus) and common carp (Cyprinus carpio) with some exotic species coming from nearby Lake Banyoles, whereas Mediterranean barbel (Barbus meridionalis) predominated in the rest of the Terri River. Along the longitudinal gradient, fish assemblage displayed discontinuous variation and disappearance in more polluted areas. Fish abundance was significantly correlated with summer oxygen concentration and decreased in downstream sampling sites. Species richness was higher in downstream sampling sites due to the proximity of the Ter River. Common carp size increased progressively along the course of the Terri River, whereas the pattern for the eel was the opposite, with the smallest found in downstream sampling sites and a gradual increase in size in the upper reaches. The natural zonation in the fish assemblage of the Terri River is presently altered to a high degree by habitat degradations, pollution, and dispersal of exotic species.

Additionally, moving from the micro- to meso-scale, biodiversity is enhanced. We performed an indoor microcosm experiment to determine the effects of agricultural run-off (ARO) on a defined benthic-pelagic community comprising primary producers and primary consumers, exposed to ambient summer temperature and +3.5 degrees C. Treatments were replicated in two water types (standard Volvic and Munich well water). We then scaled up to outdoor mesocosms using an ARO concentration gradient and +3 degrees C warming above ambient temperature, using Munich well water. We included the same benthic macroorganisms but more complex periphyton and plankton communities. All the functional groups were affected by stressors in the microcosms, and a shift from macrophyte to phytoplankton dominance was observed. While effects were present, they were less pronounced in the mesocosms, where a higher biodiversity may have modified the responses of the system to the stressors. The stressor effects observed in controlled experiments may thus be masked in more complex outdoor experiments, but should not be interpreted as "no effects".

In this work, four well-placed sediment cores were extracted from the mud areas in the ECSs, and the Pb-210-dated cores were analyzed to yield historical concentration profiles of PBDEs in the area. The results showed that there was a persistent increase from 1970s and almost no clear sign in the decline of PBDEs until recently in China. More importantly, there was a faster increase of PBDEs from 1990s in China; while this period was just shown as gradually leveling off or even declining trends in developed countries. The persistently increasing trend of PBDEs in China since 1990s could be largely due to the booming of the manufacturingindustry and unexpectedly transfer of PBDE pollution from developed countries to China. Besides, the relative high concentrations and fluxes of PBDEs in the core from coastal ECS located near a Well-known electrical/electronic waste (e-waste) recycling area suggests an important contribution of PBDE emissions from recycling centers of e-waste in China. Although efforts in environmental monitoring of PBDE contamination have been substantially increased over the last decade, China is still lagging behind in terms of nationwide regulation of PBDE usage and treatment of disposal PBDE-containing products.

J	BUKAVECKAS, PA				BUKAVECKAS, PA			CHANGES IN PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY ASSOCIATED WITH LIMING AND REACIDIFICATION OF AN ADIRONDACK LAKE	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												The addition of calcium carbonate to a clearwater acidic lake had a significant effect on phytoplankton abundance and on the biomass-specific rate of production. Chlorophyll concentrations and productivity : biomass ratios were strongly correlated with changes in lake acidity associated with liming and reacidification (r2 = 0.89 and 0.73, respectively). Summer mean chlorophyll increased by 0.9 Mg m-3 for each unit increase in lake pH, whereas productivity : biomass ratios decreased from >2 to <1, with an increase in pH from 5-5 to 7.0. Higher phytoplankton standing crops after liming were attributed to lower grazing rates following the decline of the dominant zooplankton taxa. A model relating biomass-specific productivity to incident light levels was found to be useful in interpreting treatment effects on productivity. Incident light and biomass (based on chlorophyll) accounted for 81% of the variability in productivity at the treated site. Comparisons of photosynthesis-irradiance curves indicated that the maximum photosynthetic capacity was higher following the watershed liming, compared to data collected after lake liming and during reacidification.

St. John, Polygonum amphibium L. and Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin. ex Steud. were measured in situ. Virtually all biomass of E. nuttallii was located above ground all year, while a substantial portion occurred underground in Polygonum amphibium and Phragmites australis, the latter persisting in winter. The ratio surface area of aboveground biomass:total biomass was highest in E. nuttallii [0.1133 m2 g-1 ashfree dry weight (AFDW)] and far lower in both other species (0.007 m2 g-1 AFDW in Polygonum amphibium and 0-0.003 m2 g-1 AFDW in Phragmites australis). Chlorophyll occurred mainly in the epidermal cell layer, covering leaves and stems in E. nuttallii, but only the leaves of Polygonum amphibium and Phragmites australis. The average relative growth rates (.hivin.R) varied from 0.019 in E. nuttallii to 0.008 in Polygonum amphibium and 0.009 g AFDW g-1 AFDW day-1 in Phragmites australis. The efficiencies of solar energy conversion were lower than in most terrestrial plants: 0.10% in E. nuttallii, 0.67% in Polygonum amphibium and 0.32% in Phragmites australis. The carbohydrate reserves were lower in E. nuttallii than in both other species. Starch was the principle component in E. nuttallii and in the underground organs of Polygonum amphibium and Phragmites australis, but sugars predominated in the aboveground diomass of both latter species. The respiratory requirement for growth early in the season was estimated to assess the plants'' survival capacity. The carbohydrate reserves in E. nuttallii sufficed only for growth during 0.4 days, making the use of alternative reserves of protein likely. The energetic situation for Polygonum amphibium and Phragmites australis was more favorable: the carbohydrate reserves of the former sufficed for growth during 2.4 days and those of the latter for growth during 4.0 days. The performance of the three plant species in Lake Vechten is discussed.																			0304-3770	1879-1522				AUG	1987	28	3-4					353	372		10.1016/0304-3770(87)90011-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-3770(87)90011-8													WOS:A1987J832600011

This paper explores the landform related controls on fugitive PM10 dust emissions from soil surfaces surrounding the Salton Sea by measuring soil properties combined with estimating the in situ PM10 dust emissions using a novel small portable field wind tunnel (PI-SWERL). The locations surrounding the Salton Sea were selected to encompass varying geomorphic landforms, including exposed shoreline areas with playa characteristics, barnacle covered beaches, dry washes, interdunes, and exposures of ancient Lake Cahuilla. The largest variation in potential dust emissions over the sampling period was from the playa-like surfaces that are near the open water and exhibited surface salt crusts, with the highest emissions measured from these surfaces during the winter. However, the largest emitting landform over the entire period were the dry washes that only exhibited a small degree of silt/clay crust, if any and were composed mainly of sand-sized particles. The highest emissions from all surfaces are compared with dust fluxes measured from Owens Lake and are within the same order of magnitude as those also measured with wind tunnels. Salt content did not show any statistically significant correlation with PM10 dust emissions during any sampling period for the soils tested, which is attributed to the complications associating soil salt contents with particular salt crystal habit.

Here we test the effect of a trophic cascade on diatom (Asterionella formosa) blooms in subtropical, eutrophic Lake Taihu, China. A long-term data series (2005-2015) on planktivorous fish, zooplankton and diatoms has been analysed. Structural equation modelling is used to test our hypotheses about the influences of top-down and bottom-up forces on A. formosa. Since 2009, a spring bloom of A. formosa has occurred in the lake, coinciding with a reduction of Daphnia galeata biomass and of total cladoceran biomass following a marked increase in the stock of planktivorous fish (bighead carp and silver carp). Light, phosphorus (total and soluble reactive phosphate) and silica did not act as limiting factors for the growth of A. formosa. Structural equation modelling analysis showed that top-down effects of cladocerans on A. formosa biomass were more important than bottom-up effects (wind speed and soluble reactive phosphate). Although A. formosa was negatively correlated with total nitrogen, total with other inorganic nitrogen (NO3 and NH4) did not restrict the proliferation of diatom blooms after 2007. These results suggested that the substantial reduction of the Daphnia population caused a diatom bloom through a trophic cascade by planktivorous fish. Our study provides new insight into the effects of trophic interactions on diatom bloom formation in natural freshwater ecosystems.					; Jeppesen, Erik/O-2667-2019	Liu, Xia/0000-0002-6225-9179; Li, Yun/0000-0003-3655-2475; 													0046-5070	1365-2427				NOV	2022	67	11					1938	1948		10.1111/fwb.13986	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.13986		AUG 2022											WOS:000844152900001

The Cretaceous Denglouku Formation can be divided into four third-order sequences. Each sequence consists of two systems tracts: a transgressive systems tract and a high-stand systems tract. A braided river delta is the main sedimentary facies in the study interval. These sequences were deposited in a back-arc rift basin during a transitional period from fault-dominant subsidence to downwarp subsidence. A sequence stratigraphic model is discussed based on the above interpretations. Typical unconformities are absent due to the absence of base level fall. Instead, maximum regressive surfaces, which are generally reworked by transgressive ravinement, act as the sequence boundaries. Each sequence bounded by these surfaces can be divided into two depositional units: a transgressive unit (TST) and normal regressive unit (HST). On land, a TST is characterized by a decreasing channel/floodplain ratio, and an HST is characterized by an increasing channel/floodplain ratio. Lakes are analogs to marine settings in which the shoreline moves forwards and backwards, and their strata show alternating retrogradation and progradation patterns. The results of this study may encourage the application of similar approaches to the correlation of successions within and beyond the Songliao Basin. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

For this purpose, the water and sediment samples were collected during the winter turnover and stratification periods, and bacterial communities were assessed by metabarcoding. The results showed that temperature shaped the bacterial community patterns in the lake. While the bacterial communities of the water samples showed high similarity during the mixing period, communities had distinctive patterns in the epilimnion and hypolimnion during stratification. The diversity and evenness of the bacterial communities increased with depth, whereas the bacterial communities of sediments were more even and diverse than in water. Proteobacteria members dominated the sediment communities representing 41% to 62% of the total reads in the samples. Particularly, Gammaproteobacteria was the major class found in the sediment; higher abundances were recorded in the mixing period representing 33-51%. Additionally, Actinobacteria species were more abundant in the water samples representing 22-52% of all reads during the stratification period. Due to the complete mixing conditions in the lake, a homogenized bacterial community structure was observed in the lake with minor spatial changes, and a clear divergence was observed between epilimnion and hypolimnion. On the other hand, the sediment bacterial community showed a more stable profile.					köker, latife/AAB-7634-2020; Oguz, Ayca/AAA-4929-2020; Ozbayram, Gozde/AAB-8784-2020; , merbay/AAB-9694-2020; , reyhan/AAB-8612-2020; Oğuz, Ayça/AAA-4929-2020	Ozbayram, Gozde/0000-0002-5416-0611; Oguz, Ayca/0000-0002-0711-2967; 														2073-4441				DEC	2022	14	24							4097	10.3390/w14244097	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w14244097													WOS:000902877500001

Different Migratory Strategies of Invasive Common Carp and Native Northern Pike in the American Midwest Suggest an Opportunity for Selective Management Strategies	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Inundated floodplains, backwaters, and wetlands are important spawning habitats for many freshwater fish. In Midwestern North America and areas of northern Europe, the Common Carp Cyprinus carpio and Northern Pike Esox lucius inhabit many of the same watersheds and perform migrations to interconnected wetlands during the spring to spawn. In this study, the movement patterns of adult Northern Pike and Common Carp from lakes into adjoining wetlands were assessed in Minnesota to determine how and when these species moved, and if Common Carp might be blocked or trapped without disrupting the Northern Pike. Adult Northern Pike migrated over an extended several-week period starting early each March, when temperatures were greater than 4 degrees C and when the fish were fully sexually mature (i.e., females were ovulated and running with eggs, and males were spermiating). In contrast, adult Common Carp migrated over relatively short time periods that lasted just a few days between April and June, and whose specific timing varied but always occurred after water temperatures rose to 10 degrees C and usually coincided with rain. Migrating Common Carp were in prespawning condition (i.e., females were not yet ovulated) and appeared to be homing as stream selection was very specific. Less than half of the Common Carp population migrated each year, reinforcing earlier observations that Common Carp likely conduct partial migrations. Overlap between Northern Pike and Common Carp was minimal, suggesting that management strategies using removable barriers, for example, could be used to control invasive Common Carp without affecting native Northern Pike populations.

J	Ström, TE; Klaveness, D				Ström, TE; Klaveness, D			Hunnebotn:: a seawater basin transformed by natural and anthropogenic processes	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												The lake Hunnebotn (A = 1 km(2), z(max) = 11 m) has become separated from the sea by isostasis, but a 1.5-m-deep channel is held open by periodic dredging. Water exchange is minor due to the small tidal range (21 cm) and the length of the channel (1.8 km), but there may be an inflow of seawater at spring tides. The terrestrial watershed runoff may be fertilized by sewage and agricultural runoff despite some measures taken to prevent this. Historical and new records of biological communities indicate variations in sensitivity to different phases of the isolation and eutrophication process. The native oyster was most sensitive and disappeared first. Later, the eelgrass disappeared possibly due to overgrowth by epiphytic algae, and finally there was a massive littoral-sublittoral invasion of green algae. The lake should not be left in this condition, for aesthetic reasons and because marine inlets and eutrophic brackish water may serve as refugia for spore populations of toxic microalgae. Improving surface water quality will require better control of anthropogenic sources, but bursts and leaks of nutrients from the anoxic monimolimnion cannot be controlled.

J	Zhu, L; Wu, YL; Song, LR; Gan, NQ				Zhu, Lin; Wu, Yanlong; Song, Lirong; Gan, Nanqin			Ecological Dynamics of Toxic Microcystis spp. and Microcystin-Degrading Bacteria in Dianchi Lake, China	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Toxic cyanobacterial blooms directly threaten both human safety and the ecosystem of surface waters. The widespread occurrence of these organisms, coupled with the tumor-promoting properties of the microcystin toxins that they produce, demands action to mitigate their potential impacts and, thus, a robust understanding of their ecological dynamics. In the present work, the abundance of toxic Microcystis spp. and microcystin (MC)-degrading bacteria in Dianchi Lake, located in Yunnan Province, China, was studied using quantitative PCR. Samples were taken at monthly intervals from June 2010 to December 2011 at three sampling stations within this freshwater lake. Results revealed that variation in the abundance of both total Microcystis spp. and toxic Microcystis spp. exhibited similar trends during the period of the algal bloom, including the reinvasion, pelagic growth, sedimentation, and overwintering periods, and that the proportion of toxic Microcystis was highest during the bloom and lowest in winter. Importantly, we observed that peaks in mlrA gene copy numbers of MC-degrading bacteria occurred in the months following observed peaks in MC concentrations. To understand this phenomenon, we added MCs to the MC-degrading bacteria (designated strains HW and SW in this study) and found that MCs significantly enhanced mlrA gene copy numbers over the number for the control by a factor of 5.2 for the microcystin-RR treatment and a factor of 3.7 for the microcystin-LR treatment. These results indicate that toxic Microcystis and MC-degrading bacteria exert both direct and indirect effects on each other and that MC-degrading bacteria also mediate a shift from toxic to nontoxic populations of Microcystis.					zhu, lin/AEC-6241-2022														0099-2240	1098-5336				MAR	2014	80	6					1874	1881		10.1128/AEM.02972-13	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.02972-13								24413601					WOS:000332025800008

The regional joint pattern and chronology, established by the characteristics of joint traces, mineralization, and surfaces, reveal a complex history of fracture development. Joint studies along the north-south trending Bowling Green fault zone indicate that northwest-trending joints formed first in response to extensional stresses associated with differential dip-slip movement in this fault zone, or by left lateral movement along this zone. Depositional features associated with Pleistocene glaciation and geomorphological features related to differential erosion of carbonate rocks dominate the topography of northern and northwestern Ohio. The region around Toledo is best characterized as a glacial lake plain. Approximately 30-40 mi (48-64 km) to the east-southeast near Clyde, OH, several Pleistocene glacial lake beach ridges and associated features are first encountered on the field trip. The beach ridges merge toward the northeast with the Columbus Limestone cuesta, which dips gently southeastward off the Findlay Arch. Dissolution of the Columbus Limestone has led to numerous karst features, including large sinkholes and high volume flow springs that emerge around the famous "Blue Hole" near Castalia, OH.																			0030-0950					MAR	1991	91	1					2	15																WOS:A1991FE02200001

As the biggest and highest plateau in the world. the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) hosts the largest high altitude population and tourists. The hypoxic environment of the QTP challenges its inhabitants and visitors both physically and psychologically. Health problems associated with the exposure to high altitude have long been observed by the scientific community. However. few studies have investigated the key drivers and their contribution to spatio-temporal oxygen concentration variations over the QTP. To fill this gap, a field investigation conducted along the Qinghai-Tibet National Highway in the summer of 2017 found that in addition to altitude, vegetation and weather conditions may also impact on oxygen concentrations. Subsequent investigations during 2018-2020 along other national highways and within the Qinghai Lake region, the Qilian Mountains and their vicinities recorded a total of 487 samples. These observations showed clear spatial and seasonal variations in oxygen concentrations. Statistical analysis showed that oxygen concentration is positively affected by air temperature and fractional vegetation cover (FVC) but decreases with altitudes. The Lindeman, Merenda and Gold (LMG) method showed that the relative contributions of altitude. air temperature. and FVC to oxygen concentration were 46.69%, 31.64% mid 3.44%, respectively, jointly explaining similar to 82% of the total variance in oxygen concentration. The remaining unexplained variance could be possibly due to factors such as vegetation net primary productivity (NPP) and soil heterotrophic respiration. Spatio-temporal variations in oxygen concentration are likely caused by the oxygen production from photosynthesis and soil heterotrophic respiration and by changes in atmospheric density resulting from topography and near-surface air temperature. Under a warming climate, improved vegetation cover and higher air temperature over the QTP could increase oxygen concentration and, to some extent, reduce the risks of hypoxia in the populations of the QTP. These findings improve our understanding of the spatio-temporal variations in oxygen concentration over the QTP in the context of climate change. The results can also be used to support the health and safety of residents and tourists and promote the sustainable development of high altitude regions worldwide.					tang, haiping/GYV-4206-2022; Chen, Yanqiang/JVN-3762-2024														0023-074X	2095-9419					2021	66	31					4028	4035		10.1360/TB-2021-0072	http://dx.doi.org/10.1360/TB-2021-0072													WOS:000719145400012
J	Tan, J; Cherkauer, KA; Chaubey, I				Tan, Jing; Cherkauer, Keith A.; Chaubey, Indrajeet			Developing a Comprehensive Spectral-Biogeochemical Database of Midwestern Rivers for Water Quality Retrieval Using Remote Sensing Data: A Case Study of the Wabash River and Its Tributary, Indiana	REMOTE SENSING												A comprehensive spectral-biogeochemical database was developed for the Wabash River and the Tippecanoe River in Indiana, United States. This database includes spectral measurements of river water, coincident in situ measurements of water quality parameters (chlorophyll (chl), non-algal particles (NAP), and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM)), nutrients (total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC)), water-column inherent optical properties (IOPs), water depths, substrate types, and bottom reflectance spectra collected in summer 2014. With this dataset, the temporal variability of water quality observations was first analyzed and studied. Second, radiative transfer models were inverted to retrieve water quality parameters using a look-up table (LUT) based spectrum matching methodology. Results found that the temporal variability of water quality parameters and nutrients in the Wabash River was closely associated with hydrologic conditions. Meanwhile, there were no significant correlations found between these parameters and streamflow for the Tippecanoe River, due to the two upstream reservoirs, which increase the settling of sediment and uptake of nutrients. The poor relationship between CDOM and DOC indicates that most DOC in the rivers was from human sources such as wastewater. It was also found that the source of water (surface runoff or combined sewer overflow (CSO)), water temperature, and nutrients were important factors controlling instream concentrations of phytoplankton. The LUT retrieved NAP concentrations were in good agreement with field measurements with slope close to 1.0 and the average estimation error was 4.1% of independently obtained lab measurements. The error for chl estimation was larger (37.7%), which is attributed to the fact that the specific absorption spectrum of chl was not well represented in this study. The LUT retrievals for CDOM experienced large variability, probably due to the small data range collected in this study and the insensitivity of R-rs to CDOM change. It is concluded that the success of the LUT method requires accurate spectral measurements and enough a priori information of the environment to construct a representative database for water quality retrieval. Therefore, future work will focus on continuing data collection in other seasons of the year and better characterization of the study area.

Alternating Subplinian and phreatomagmatic phases during the construction of a phonolitic maar-diatreme volcano (Caldera del Rey, Tenerife, Canary Islands)	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												The Early Pleistocene, well exposed, Caldera del Rey maar-diatreme volcano, Tenerife, Canary Islands was constructed during a similar to VEI 4 phonolitic eruption that involved two cycles of magmatic-to-phreatomagmatic activity and resulted in two overlapping craters aligned NE-SW. Magmatic phases fed unsteady Subplinian eruption columns that reached 8-12 km altitude and dispersed tephra to the west and southwest of the volcano and shed pyroclastic density currents. Phreatomagmatic phases, driven by explosive interactions between magma and groundwater, constructed an extensive tephra ring via deposition from ballistic curtains, pyroclastic density currents, and tephra fall. Near-optimal-scaled depth phreatomagmatic explosions (strong and/or shallow) excavated a substantial diatreme beneath the north crater and constructed a substantial tephra ring. This abruptly transitioned to deeper-than-optimal scaled depth explosions (weak and/or deep) that erupted mostly fine ash which was dispersed by dilute pyroclastic density currents and fallout and filled the south crater. At distances of >4 km from the volcano, over a metre of ash and pumice accumulated during the phreatomagmatic phases. The Caldera del Rey volcano provides an instructive study on how interaction between ascending felsic magma and groundwater can modify Subplinian eruptions.																			0377-0273	1872-6097				NOV	2023	443								107920	10.1016/j.jvolgeores.2023.107920	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jvolgeores.2023.107920		OCT 2023											WOS:001106886300001
J	Tang, J; Guo, XL; Chang, Y; Lu, GX; Qi, P				Tang, Jie; Guo, Xueliang; Chang, Yi; Lu, Guangxian; Qi, Peng			Temporospatial Distribution and Trends of Thunderstorm, Hail, Gale, and Heavy Precipitation Events over the Tibetan Plateau and Associated Mechanisms	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												Temporospatial distribution and trends of thunderstorm, hail, gale, and heavy precipitation events over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) as well as the associated mechanisms with observational data from 1979 to 2016 are investigated, which have not been fully studied under a changing climate. The results indicate that thunderstorm, hail, and gale events over the whole TP show significant decreasing trends, while heavy precipitation events have an insignificant increasing trend. The southeast and central south subregions have obvious significant decreasing trends in thunderstorm, hail, and gale events, while the northeast subregion has a significant increasing trend in heavy precipitation events. It is found that the atmospheric circulation anomaly caused by the northwestern Atlantic sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) should be responsible for these changes. A strong wave train triggered by the northwestern Atlantic SST anomaly propagates from the northern Atlantic to East Asia through Europe, and induces a more upper-level warming over the TP and an anomalous anticyclonic circulation near the Lake Baikal, resulting in a more stable atmosphere and blocking effect, which forces the midlatitude westerlies and associated cold air to shift poleward. The weakened cold-air advection over the TP decreases the baroclinic instability and convection initiation, and finally causes the significant decreasing trends in severe weather events. On the other hand, the enhanced easterly winds in the southern flank of the anticyclonic circulation can significantly increase the water vapor flux from the eastern boundary of the TP and heavy precipitation events in the northeast subregion.					; Qi, Peng/HLW-5813-2023; Chang, Yi/MYS-5719-2025	Guo, Xueliang/0000-0002-9372-2293; Chang, Yi/0000-0003-3595-021X													0894-8755	1520-0442				DEC	2021	34	24					9623	9646		10.1175/JCLI-D-21-0494.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-21-0494.1													WOS:000752652100003

Forecast is based on the Freshwater Lake (FLake) model integrated into HIRLAM. Additionally, an independent objective analysis of lake surface water temperature (LSWT) combines the short forecast of FLake to observations from the Finnish Environment Institute (SYKE). The resulting description of lake surface state - forecast FLake variables and analysed LSWT - was compared to SYKE observations of lake water temperature, freeze-up and break-up dates, and the ice thickness and snow depth for 2012-2018 over 45 lakes in Finland. During the ice-free period, the predicted LSWT corresponded to the observations with a slight overestimation, with a systematic error of + 0.91 K. The colder temperatures were underrepresented and the maximum temperatures were too high. The objective analysis of LSWT was able to reduce the bias to +0.35 K. The predicted freeze-up dates corresponded well to the observed dates, mostly within the accuracy of a week. The forecast break-up dates were far too early, typically several weeks ahead of the observed dates. The growth of ice thickness after freeze-up was generally overestimated. However, practically no predicted snow appeared on lake ice. The absence of snow, presumably due to an incorrect security coefficient value, is suggested to be also the main reason for the inaccurate simulation of the lake ice melting in spring.

Relative risk assessment for ballast-mediated invasions at Canadian Arctic ports	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												Vector-based risk assessment is a powerful and efficient management approach for nonindigenous species (NIS). By managing a vector, an entire assemblage of associated NIS is simultaneously considered. The majority of current risk assessment frameworks have been conducted for a single, or selected few, target species and thus are not useful for managing vectors transporting a large number of potentially unknown species. Here we develop a predictive framework to assess relative invasion risk for a vector (ballast water) transporting an unknown species assemblage, using the Canadian Arctic as a case study. Ballast water discharge is a known high-risk vector globally, but its magnitude in the Arctic has not been well characterized. Our framework determined relative invasion risks between different transit pathways by quantifying the probability of NIS successfully transiting all stages of the invasion process and the magnitude of consequences of introduction to those ports. Churchill, Manitoba was ranked at 'higher' invasion risk via ballast water discharged by international merchant vessels than any other recipient port studied. The overall pattern of ballast water discharge suggests that water originating from coastal domestic sources carried by international merchant vessels may be important for dispersal of NIS. In addition, ballast-mediated NIS are more likely to arrive to the Hudson Bay region during summer months. These results can be useful for developing prevention and early detection programs for the region. Our risk assessment framework is not limited to ballast water and could be applied to other vectors for effective management of NIS.

The multiproxy analysis offers a unique opportunity to study the evolution of this coastal landscape in relation to past sea level and climate changes in the southern high latitudes. After ca. 19,000 cal yr BP, the sediments were subjected to subaerial exposure and oxidation linked to a low sea level. The Sr/Ba ratio (a paleosalinity geochemical parameter) indicates variations in the water body level, and diatoms imply the existence of an ephemeral and brackish-freshwater body subject to desiccation under arid conditions. Between ca. 11,600 and 8500 cal yr BP, a shrubby steppe vegetation, mainly composed of Asteraceae subf. Asteroideae, spread over the coastal area associated with a shallow freshwater body and the deposition of fine-grained sediments in low-energy environments, all indicative of low effective moisture and warm climate conditions. Between ca. 8500 and 8100 cal yr BP, salt carpet vegetation, dominated by Chenopodiaceae, developed around a coastal lagoon in response to the Holocene marine transgression. The record of dinocysts and geochemical data indicate marine influence at this time. Between ca. 8100 and 7000 cal yr BP, salt marshes colonized the coastal area. A coastal lagoon with a more restricted connection to the sea and minor freshwater input are inferred, linked to the beginning of a regressive phase. After ca. 7000 cal yr BP, grassland vegetation and an open shrub stratum developed along with a shallow lake (pan) that was disconnected from the sea, following a fall in the sea level and regression. Fluctuations in the water level of the pan and changes in the physical-chemical conditions, as indicated by fluctuations in Mn/Fe, Ti/Ca, Rb/Sr, Ca, TIC and TOC, suggest abrupt events of desiccation and flooding. Between ca. 4500 and 2000 cal yr BP a drier phase is indicated by changes in vegetation, algal content and geochemistry of the pan. A grassland vegetation and a shallow lake with seasonal water level variations characterized the last 2000 years. Our results from LLV area match well with Andean forest fluctuations and regional climatic conditions recorded from Tierra del Fuego and Chilean southwest.					; Montes, aLEJANDRO/HHS-2220-2022; Santiago, Fernando/AGN-5652-2022	Diaz, Pablo Esteban/0000-0003-2069-5404; Santiago, Fernando C./0000-0002-0357-9965; 													0031-0182	1872-616X				NOV 1	2020	557								109941	10.1016/j.palaeo.2020.109941	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2020.109941													WOS:000565723200013
J	UNDERWOOD, J; DONALD, AP; STONER, JH				UNDERWOOD, J; DONALD, AP; STONER, JH			INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE USE OF LIMESTONE TO COMBAT ACIDIFICATION IN 2 LAKES IN WEST WALES	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Results are reported of liming investigations in two acid lakes which had mean pH vlues before liming of 4.2 and 4.8. Before any treatment was carried out, laboratory tests were undertaken using lake water to determine the most suitable dosing material and the optimum rate of application. In order to improve water quality to pH > 5.5 for a reasonable period of time, overdosing to pH 7.0 was found to be necessary, given the diluting effects of acid input streams. The projected decay of pH and calcium concentration during natural lake flushing was simulated by diluting limestone-dosed lake water samples with raw lake water: the time taken for pH to fall to 5.5 could then be calculated from the catchment hydrology of each lake. Following liming in April 1985, maximum pH readings of 6.9 and 7.0 were achieved at the two lakes. Water quality has subsequently behaved largely as predicted, although one lake has re-acidified more rapidly than expected. Whilst the technique described has proved to be effective and economic, the ecological consequences are still being evaluated, as are alternative techniques such as catchment liming.																			0301-4797	1095-8630				JAN	1987	24	1					29	40																WOS:A1987F994000003
J	Li, ZG; Lyu, SH; Wen, LJ; Zhao, L; Ao, YH; Wang, SY				Li, Zhaoguo; Lyu, Shihua; Wen, Lijuan; Zhao, Lin; Ao, Yinhuan; Wang, Shaoying			Effect of a cold, dry air incursion on atmospheric boundary layer processes over a high-altitude lake in the Tibetan Plateau	ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH												High-altitude lakes are frequently exposed to extreme meteorological conditions, but the surface and atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) processes have received little attention under specific weather conditions. This study used the multi-source field data, re-analysis and remote sensing data to investigate the varying patterns and driving forces of the convective boundary layer (CBL) height over Ngoring Lake in the Tibetan Plateau (TP) before and after the cold air incursion. Daily cumulative surface heat flux and buoyancy flux over the land were markedly larger than those over the lake on a clear summer day, but an opposite pattern was observed accompanied by the cold air incursion. CBLS determined by the potential temperature thinned ( depth < 100 m) over the lake in the daytime and thickened (400-600 m) at night on a clear day. Along with the arrival of the cold air, CBL rapidly thickened to 2280 m over the lake, exceeded than the maximum value at adjacent Madoi station. Cold air dramatically cooled the middle-upper atmosphere but the temperature of the lower atmosphere cooled down slowly, partly due to a sharp increase of sensible heat flux over the lake, both of which linked up to weaken the potential temperature gradient. Moreover, increasing wind speed and vertical wind shear further facilitated the buoyancy flux to exert higher heat convection efficiency. All of these factors acted together to cause the rapid growth of CBL over the lake. This investigation provided a more in-depth knowledge of boundary layer dynamics in the lake rich region of the TP.

The result indicated that two species of plants were highly efficient in absorbing and purifying nitrogen(N), phosphourus(P) and COD at the early stage of plant growth. With the strong growth, a great of quantity sediment and nutrients of overlying water were absorbed by Nymphaea alba and Trapa bicornis. During the experiment, the TN removal rate of Nymphaea alba can be up to 71.2% in water, while the TP removal rate of Nymphaea alba and Trapa bicornis can amount to 62.5% and 87.5% respectively. It can make for controlling the overgrowth of algae in summer water. At the same time, Nymphaea alba and Trapa bicornis both are good economic crops, which can increase the income of local residents and facilitate planting. Therefore, Nymphaea alba and Trapa bicornis are preferred as in Baiyangdian lake's aquatic purification plants.

However, there is a paucity of data regarding the postglacial transgression. The position of the PG at the edge of major synoptic systems of the Indian Ocean Summer Monsoon (IOSM) and Mid-latitude Westerlies (MLW) makes the environment particularly sensitive to Holocene climate shifts. To investigate the timing of the flooding and to detect the impacts of significant climate shifts on the regional environment during the Holocene, a multiproxy study was conducted on three short sediment cores from two deep sites in the PG. Sedimentological, palynological and geochemical analyses were performed on the cores. The results show that inundation of the western part of the PG that started from ca. 11.5 ka bp continued with successive prominent phases of transgression centered on 10.4 and 9.2 ka cal bp, and definitive marine conditions were established around 8.8 ka cal bp. The IOSM was the dominant system in the region until about 9 to similar to 6.3 ka cal bp. After that time, the intensity of the IOSM declined, as MLW dominated the region after similar to 6.3 ka cal bp. These climatic shifts induced significant changes in regional vegetation and hydrology, and possibly triggered socio-cultural transformations.

Demographic history shapes North American gray wolf genomic diversity and informs species' conservation	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY												Effective population size estimates are critical information needed for evolutionary predictions and conservation decisions. This is particularly true for species with social factors that restrict access to breeding or experience repeated fluctuations in population size across generations. We investigated the genomic estimates of effective population size along with diversity, subdivision, and inbreeding from 162,109 minimally filtered and 81,595 statistically neutral and unlinked SNPs genotyped in 437 grey wolf samples from North America collected between 1986 and 2021. We found genetic structure across North America, represented by three distinct demographic histories of western, central, and eastern regions of the continent. Further, grey wolves in the northern Rocky Mountains have lower genomic diversity than wolves of the western Great Lakes and have declined over time. Effective population size estimates revealed the historical signatures of continental efforts of predator extermination, despite a quarter century of recovery efforts. We are the first to provide molecular estimates of effective population size across distinct grey wolf populations in North America, which ranged between N-e similar to 275 and 3050 since early 1980s. We provide data that inform managers regarding the status and importance of effective population size estimates for grey wolf conservation, which are on average 5.2-9.3% of census estimates for this species. We show that while grey wolves fall above minimum effective population sizes needed to avoid extinction due to inbreeding depression in the short term, they are below sizes predicted to be necessary to avoid long-term risk of extinction.

Predicting the Inland Penetration of Long-Lake-Axis-Parallel Snowbands	WEATHER AND FORECASTING												Predicting the inland penetration of lake-effect long-lake-axis-parallel (LLAP) snowbands is crucial to public safety because LLAP bands can produce hazardous weather well downwind of the parent lake. Accordingly, hypotheses for the variation in inland penetration of LLAP-band radar echoes (InPen) are formulated and tested. The hypothesis testing includes an examination of statistical relationships between environmental variables and InPen for 34 snapshots of LLAP bands observed during the Ontario Winter Lake-effect Systems (OWLeS) field campaign. Several previously proposed predictors of LLAP-band formation or InPen demonstrate weak correlations with InPen during OWLeS. A notable exception is convective boundary layer (CBL) depth, which is strongly correlated with InPen. In addition to CBL depth, InPen is strongly correlated with cold-air advection in the upper portion of the CBL, suggesting that boundary layer destabilization produced by vertically differential cold-air advection may be an important inland power source for preexisting LLAP bands. This power production is quantified through atmospheric energetics and the resulting variable, differential thermal advection power (DTAP), yields reasonably skillful predictions of InPen. Nevertheless, an InPen model developed using DTAP is outperformed by an empirical model combining CBL depth and potential temperature advection in the upper portion of the CBL. This two-variable model explains 76% of the observed InPen variance when tested on independent data. Finally, implications for operational forecasting of InPen are discussed.																			0882-8156	1520-0434				OCT	2018	33	5					1435	1451		10.1175/WAF-D-18-0033.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/WAF-D-18-0033.1													WOS:000448256100002
J	Howell, NL; Butler, EB; Guerrero, B				Howell, Nathan L.; Butler, Erick B.; Guerrero, Bridget			Water quality variation with storm runoff and evaporation in playa wetlands	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Playas are the often most noticeable surface water feature in the Southern High Plains. The purpose of our study is to provide local and timely reference data on playa water quality and quantity in drier and wetter weather conditions. Water quality parameters of three playas in Texas, in the summer of 2016, were monitored via weekly environmental sampling. Annual water volume-depth dynamics within the study playas were also estimated by water balance informed by climate and geospatial data. The results showed that both direct rainfall and runoff affect the volume of water within the playa where the volume of runoff entering into a playa is contingent upon the surrounding drainage area. In addition, water quality does vary substantially from playa to playa (conductivity 180-850 mu S/cm, TOC 13-81 mg/L) and between playa and non-playa surface water. Differences were related to local soils, drainage area size/slope, and land use. It was also found from the water quality analysis that playas are capable of containing a quality of water that would make them an attractive habitat for wildlife. The greatest economic value of playas may be their ability to contain high quantities of biodiversity though the future of their capacity to do so is uncertain. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The sediments studied were sampled from a deep peri-alpine lake that has experienced both dramatic shifts in trophic conditions and large-scale climatic changes. Palaeolimnological proxies were combined with statistical modelling to investigate the relative influence of phosphorus concentrations and temperature changes on the extent of Planktothrix blooms over the last century. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the overall composition of the cyanobacterial community changed over the transition from oligotrophic to eutrophic conditions. When the relative abundance of Planktothrix decreased in the 1970s, concomitant with eutrophication, total cyanobacterial abundance remained high and more Anabaena and Microcystis sequences were detected. In spite of such drastic environmental changes, the lake provided a constant niche for one particular Planktothrix species, which was consistently present from the 1920s to the present day. Phosphorus concentration was found to be the dominant driver of the relative abundance of P.rubescens, with the highest abundances observed during mesotrophic conditions. The relative role of climate was nutrient-dependent, with warmer springs having a positive effect on P.rubescens abundance only during mesotrophic periods. Overall, this study confirms that analysis of genetic signatures preserved in sediment archives allows assessment of key palaeoenvironmental indicator species that have no diagnostic microscopic cellular features in the sediment record. In the case of cyanobacteria, palaeogenetics offer unique opportunities to anticipate how future climate change might affect the response of P.rubescens to phosphorus concentration.

Mississippi River Flood of 2008: Observations of a Large Freshwater Diversion on Physical, Chemical, and Biological Characteristics of a Shallow Estuarine Lake	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												High nitrogen (N) loading to coastal aquatic systems can be expressed as increased algal production and subsequent low dissolved oxygen. In April, 2008, predictions for extreme flood stage for the Lower Mississippi River triggered the opening of the Bonnet Carre Spillway, a major release valve for the river. The spillway diverted similar to 8 km(3) of water over one month of operation into Lake Pontchartrain with a concomitant 10000 t of NO(3)-N. Satellite imagery, physical, water quality, and chlorophyll a (chl a) measurements show that the Mississippi River plume mixed with <40% of the lake during this time, and much of the nutrient load was transported to the coastal ocean. Nitrate, dissolved reactive phosphorus (P), and dissolved silica (Si) concentrations were 4.8, 5.0, and 3.2 times higher, respectively, within the river plume when compared with those of the lake water. Despite the high nutrient concentrations within the river plume, phytoplankton biomass, evidenced by chl a concentrations, was low. Much of the nutrient load appeared to bypass the lake and was transported to the coastal ocean during the opening of the diversion. The potential removal of a total of 7.6% of the N load from the Mississippi River during the one month of flood level flow may have been a contributing factor in the lower than predicted hypoxia zone off the Louisiana coast during the summer of 2008.

Simulations of cool, warm, and intermediate years were rerun with meteorology from four general circulation models with a doubling of CO2. In all simulations with doubled CO2 there is an earlier onset of stratification, increased summer epilimnetic temperature ( 1-7 degrees C), and an increased intensity and longer duration of stratification. Maximum surface temperatures at times may exceed upper lethal limits of warm and cool water fish in some scenarios. Suitable thermal habitat for cold water, cool water, and warm water fish generally increases in all scenarios after climate change. Changes in the vertical migration of Daphnia, however, are expected to vary depending on the interaction of thermal stratification and fish habitat use. In northern Wisconsin lakes with cold water planktivores, habitat overlap between fish and zooplankton is expected to decrease, while in southern Wisconsin lakes habitat overlap is expected to increase. Although most physical responses of lakes to climate change are consistent among all climate scenarios, biological responses will likely be more variable owing to the complex nature of factors determining ecological interactions in lakes.					; De+Stasio, Bart/W-9030-2019	Nibbelink, Nathan/0000-0003-0793-0502; 													0024-3590	1939-5590				JUL	1996	41	5					1136	1149		10.4319/lo.1996.41.5.1136	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1996.41.5.1136													WOS:A1996VN45800037
J	WOLF, HG; CARVALHO, GR				WOLF, HG; CARVALHO, GR			RESTING EGGS OF LAKE-DAPHNIA .2. INSITU OBSERVATIONS ON THE HATCHING OF EGGS AND THEIR CONTRIBUTION TO POPULATION AND COMMUNITY STRUCTURE	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												To investigate the contribution of hatchlings from lake Daphnia resting eggs (ephippia) to population and community structure, hatching was monitored in situ from April to November 1986 in two north German lakes. Hatching traps were placed on the sediments and the incidence, genetic and species composition of ephippal hatchlings determined twice-weekly. Hatching began in April after the thawing of ice, and continued for 3-4 weeks until the lakes stratified. There was no obvious relationship between the onset and duration of hatching and the environmental variables recorded, namely Secchi depth, surface temperature, temperature and oxygen concentration at the sediment-water interface. Among the hatchlings were D. galeata, D. hyalina and their interspecific hybrid. In the lake which contained overwintering animals the number of ephippal hatchlings was approximately one third of the total number of juveniles present in the lake. In the second lake, no adults were recorded during winter and the population was probably founded by ephippal hatchlings alone. There was good agreement, in the short term, between the proportion of each species represented among hatchlings and the subsequent species composition in the lake. The hatchlings were genetically diverse, and alleles were representative of those alleles present in contemporary populations.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				DEC	1989	22	3					471	478		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1989.tb01119.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1989.tb01119.x													WOS:A1989CA92500011
J	Gázquez, F; Calaforra, JM				Gazquez, Fernando; Calaforra, Jose-Maria			Origin of double-tower raft cones in hypogenic caves	EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS												In the present paper, we describe the genetic mechanism that causes the precipitation of raft cones in caves. These speleothems usually form in a hydrothermal and epiphreatic environment where dripwater, dripping repeatedly over the same spot, sinks calcite rafts that were floating on the water surface of a cave pool. In particular, the paper describes a new variety of raft cones that were recently discovered in the Paradise Chamber of the Sima de la Higuera Cave (Murcia, south-eastern Spain) based on their morphological and morphometric characteristics. These speleothems, dubbed double-tower cones', have a notch in the middle and look like two cones, one superimposed over the other. The genetic mechanism that gave rise to the double-tower cones must include an intermediate stage of rapid calcite raft precipitation, caused by a drop in the water table and by changes in cave ventilation leading to greater carbon dioxide (CO2) degassing and evaporation over the surface of the thermal lake where these speleothems formed. Calcite rafts were deposited in Paradise Chamber, completely covering many of the cones. Later, conditions for slower calcite raft precipitation were restored and some of the cones continued to grow at the same points. When the water table finally fell below the level of Paradise Chamber, the tower cones became exposed, as the incongruent deposits of calcite rafts were dissolved and mobilized to lower cave levels.

J	Canfield, TJ; Jones, JR				Canfield, TJ; Jones, JR			Zooplankton abundance, biomass, and size-distribution in selected midwestern waterbodies and relation with trophic state	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												Zooplankton abundance and biomass were measured in natural lakes and impoundments in Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, and Oklahoma during summer. Zooplankton exhibited wide ranges of abundance (70,000-1,000,000 individuals/m(3)) and biomass (45-1,000 mg/m(3)). Communities were dominated by rotifers; they comprised 70% or more of the zooplankton abundance in 41 lakes and, on average, comprised 53% of zooplankton biomass. Zooplankton in Missouri were significantly smaller than those collected in the other states, suggesting predation and regulation of size structure by zooplanktivorous fish may have differed among states at the time of this study. Within the data set, neither the microzooplankton nor the component groups of the macrozooplankton showed consistent changes with lake trophy. Among the Missouri reservoirs, Daphnia sp. decreased and Diaphanosoma sp. increased in relation to algal chlorophyll. Both zooplankton abundance and biomass were positively correlated with algal chlorophyll (r=0.30-0.58). This finding is consistent with general zooplankton-lake productivity relations, and correlations improved when our data were combined with literature values (r=0.73 and 0.78) to encompass a broad trophic state and geographic range.																			0270-5060					JUN	1996	11	2					171	181		10.1080/02705060.1996.9663476	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.1996.9663476													WOS:A1996UH81800007

Groundwater Models May Help Communicate Nuanced Risks to the Great Salt Lake	WATER												The Great Salt Lake entered the zeitgeist of environmental concern in 2022 when a coalition of scientists and activists warned in a highly publicized report that the lake might be just five years away from complete desiccation, a possibility one state official warned was tantamount to an "environmental nuclear bomb". Shortly thereafter, an unpredicted and unprecedented pluvial winter resulted in an increase in inflow, temporarily halting the lake's decline and prompting Utah's governor to mock the dire prediction as "a joke", an outcome that speaks to the tension between agenda-setting and trust-building that researchers face when sharing worst-case warnings, particularly those based on short-term variability. Here, we describe a robust relationship between the lake and groundwater in the surrounding region and demonstrate how coupled models can thus be used to improve lake elevation predictions, suggesting that while the situation may not be as dire as some have warned, the lake remains at long-term risk as a result of climate warming. We further suggest that efforts to communicate the risk of future desiccation should be informed by stochastic variability and guided by long-term fluctuations in the total water storage of the endorheic lake's watershed.					; Mukherjee, Avik/JCD-8941-2023; Hakala, Kirsti/M-7884-2018	LaPlante, Matthew/0000-0001-6502-1492; Wang, Simon/0000-0003-2009-2275; Mukherjee, Avik/0009-0003-7968-0503														2073-4441				AUG	2024	16	16							2221	10.3390/w16162221	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w16162221													WOS:001304742900001

These supraglacial rivers and lakes play an important role in controlling surface meltwater routing and storage. However, the hydromorphology of these complex supraglacial features remains poorly quantified. In this study, we mapped the multi-temporal supraglacial rivers and lakes on the northeast GrIS (area similar to 3 x 10(4) km(2)) using sixty-five 10 m Sentinel-2 multispectral satellite images acquired during the 2017 summer, and quantified their primary hydromorphology, including meltwater area fraction, meltwater volume, supraglacial river length, river sinuosity, river depth, supraglacial lake area, lake shape, and lake depth. The quantified hydromorphology was compared with variable ice flow regimes and regional climate model (RCM) runoff. The results indicate that widespread supraglacial rivers and lakes maximally cover 5.3% of the northeast GrIS, which is more than double the previous estimates and only slightly lower than that for the strongly melting southwest GrIS (similar to 7.0%). As the surface runoff increases and the snowline retreats, supraglacial rivers and lakes migrate from the ice sheet margin (similar to 400 m) to high elevations (similar to 1400 m). The satellite-mapped surface meltwater area fraction for the entire study area is positively correlated with the RCM surface runoff before the timing of peak melt (August 1), but decreases relatively slowly (by 32-45%) compared to the rapidly decreasing runoff (by 84-96%) in August. Large elevational variations were found for the peak magnitude and timing of the meltwater extent and volume. High (800-1400 m) elevation bands achieve peak values over two weeks later than low (400-800 m) elevation bands, and the 800-1000 m elevation band yields maximum peak values due to the wide distribution of supraglacial rivers. Furthermore, the supraglacial drainage patterns vary with different ice flow regimes. There are long rivers and few lakes in areas where ice deformation controls the ice flow velocity while there are short rivers and large, narrow lakes in areas where basal sliding is a major component of the ice flow. Meanwhile, long, sinuous rivers and small lakes form on the floating ice. In general, this study conducts a preliminary investigation of supraglacial rivers and lakes on the poorly-studied northeast GrIS and reveals that surface melt and ice flow control the hydromorphology of supraglacial rivers and lakes.					; Li, Mengchun/AGW-0259-2022; Yang, Kang/I-1439-2013	Li, Manchun/0009-0009-7357-5642; 													0022-1694	1879-2707				NOV	2021	602								126750	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126750	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126750		AUG 2021											WOS:000704794400041

A 15,400-year record of environmental magnetic variations in sub-alpine lake sediments from the western Nanling Mountains in South China: Implications for palaeoenvironmental changes	JOURNAL OF ASIAN EARTH SCIENCES												A detailed environmental magnetic investigation has been performed on a sub-alpine sedimentary succession deposited over the past 15,400 years in Daping Swamp in the western Nanling Mountains of South China. Magnetic parameters reveal that fine grains of pseudo-single domain (PSD) magnetite or titanomagnetite are the dominant magnetic minerals in the lake sediments and surface soils collected from the catchment, which suggests that magnetic minerals in lake sediments mainly originated from surface soil erosion of the catchment. Variation of surface runoff caused by rainfall is interpreted as the main process for transportation of weathered soils into the lake. In the Last Deglacial period (LGP, 15,400-11,500 cal a BP), the influx of magnetic minerals of detrital material may have been significantly affected by the severe dry and cold conditions of the Last Glacial Maximum. Stabilised conditions of the catchment associated with increased vegetation coverage (e.g., 8000-4500 and 2500-1000 cal a BP) limited the input of magnetic minerals. Intensive soil erosion caused by increased human activity may have given rise to abnormal increases in multiple magnetic parameters after 1000 cal a BP. Because changes in runoff and vegetation coverage are closely related to Asian summer monsoon (ASM) intensity, the sedimentary magnetism of Daping Swamp provides another source of information to investigate the evolution of the ASM.					; Smol, John/A-8838-2015; Wei, Zhiqiang/KDN-1700-2024; Xue, Jibin/KTI-2699-2024	Xue, Jibin/0000-0003-1319-3377; 													1367-9120	1878-5786				APR 1	2018	154						82	92		10.1016/j.jseaes.2017.12.005	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jseaes.2017.12.005													WOS:000425202000008

Sedimentary in-filling of an urban Great Lakes waterfront embayment and implications for threshold-driven shoreline morphodynamics, Montrose Beach, SW Lake Michigan	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												This paper addresses subaqueous and subaerial patterns of geomorphic change across Montrose Beach, an urban embayment along Chicago's engineered SW Lake Michigan coastline. Our goal was to better characterize the urban littoral zone, its sediment-transport processes, and associated shoreline morpho-dynamics (from the early 1950s to present). Succinct beach geomorphic responses to decadal base-level changes (i.e., regression during lake-level fall and transgression during lake-level rise) occurred once a morphologic threshold in the subaqueous portion of the system had been crossed. Despite continuous sand trapping, nearshore elevations were initially not conducive to promoting expansion of the subaerial beach environment, regardless of water-level condition. Rapid beach expansion after 1990 (by a factor of four in <25 years) was facilitated by prior decades of nearshore accretion. Shoreline morphodynamic tra-jectories and degree of coupling to nearshore sedimentary processes are important considerations for developing long-term beach-management strategies. Rapid cross-shore movements of the shoreline in response to oscillatory base levels are expected to persist at Montrose and other urban beaches of similar design (and nearshore conditions). This has important implications for managing urban lakefront ecosys-tems, including coastal dunes and shore-bird habitats. Few datasets have thus far quantified time-variant and threshold-driven patterns of beach geomorphic development along engineered coastlines. Such insights should help coastal managers better understand littoral sediment interconnectivity across the urban lakefront and anticipate future geomorphic trajectories of beach environments with anticipated decadal-scale oscillatory patterns in lake level.(c) 2022 International Association for Great Lakes Research.

USE OF OXYGENATION TO REPRESS RELEASE OF REDOX-SENSITIVE COMPOUNDS FROM PROFUNDAL SEDIMENT IN THE VALLE DE BVO RESERVOIR, MEXICO	REVISTA INTERNACIONAL DE CONTAMINACION AMBIENTAL												Valle de Bravo is a mesotrophic water supply reservoir located in the highlands west of Mexico City. Reservoir bottom water goes anaerobic in the summer, resulting in the release of redox-sensitive compounds from profundal sediment that degrade water quality. This study used experimental sediment-water interface chambers to assess the flux of redox-sensitive nutrients (ammonia and phosphate) and metals (manganese and iron) from profundal sediment under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Results showed that maintenance of well oxygenated conditions at the sediment-water interface resulted in a significant decrease in the sediment flux of phosphate (-0.1 vs 2.5 mg-P/m(2).d) and manganese (-1.0 vs 2.4 mg/m(2).d) compared to anaerobic conditions. Aerobic conditions also enhanced microbial ammonia oxidation to nitrate. Results indicate that hypolimnetic oxygenation, the engineered addition of dissolved oxygen to the bottom of lakes and reservoirs using pure oxygen gas, could be effective in lowering internal nutrient loading and enhancing water quality in the reservoir.

The critical shear stress required to initiate egg transport is estimated to lie in the range 0.02-0.04 N.m(-2), corresponding to mean current speeds of 10-15 cm.s(-1) at a reference height of 0.5 m above the sediment surface. On settling out, egg burial is likely. This will increase egg mortality not only by physically hindering oxygen transport to the egg, but also, in POC-rich eutrophic lake sediment, by relocating the egg in a zone of steep oxygen gradients and low mean oxygen concentrations. Microelectrode measurements and computation of the thickness of the oxygen diffusive boundary layer over the sediment reveal that even eggs that escape interment are likely to be subjected to ambient oxygen concentrations insufficient for development to hatching. It is suggested that transport and burial may in general be important factors determining coregonid egg mortality in eutrophic lakes.																			0706-652X					SEP	1994	51	9					1908	1919		10.1139/f94-192	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f94-192													WOS:A1994QF32000001

This phenomenon is the opposite of photo -bleaching, which is often observed when natural waters are irradiated. The photoproduced humic-like fluorophores observed here would be of autochthonous rather than allochthonous origin, which marks a difference with the fraction of humic substances that derives from terrestrial sources. Photogeneration of humic-like compounds can be highlighted in water samples where the fluorescence signal of initially occurring humic substances is low, so that their photobleaching is minimised. Samples that are most likely to show photoinduced formation of humic-like fluorophores are in fact characterised by high values of protein-like vs. humic-like contribution ratios to fluores-cence, as evidenced by parallel factor (PARAFAC) analysis. Mountain lakes in late summer appear to be suitable candidates to highlight the described phenomenon. In some cases, lake-water irradiation caused a decrease in the spectral slope of the absorbance that, together with increasing absorbance values, is consistent with an increase in molecular mass and aromaticity of organic matter. The absorbance increase triggered by irradiation might play a role in screening biologically harmful UV radiation, in mountain environments that would otherwise be characterised by very clear water that allows for easy transmission of UV light along the water column.					; Berto, Silvia/AAE-5465-2020; MOUNIER, Stéphane/P-9135-2015; Vione, Davide/A-4047-2008; Gligorovski, Sasho/ABH-8175-2020	Yiqun, Wang/0000-0002-6417-6449; Carena, Luca/0000-0002-1493-5873; Gligorovski, Sasho/0000-0003-4151-2224; 													0045-6535	1879-1298				APR	2023	319								137972	10.1016/j.chemosphere.2023.137972	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2023.137972		FEB 2023						36716935					WOS:000963747000001

The vast external loadings from sewage and other wastewater discharge that European lakes have historically received have been dramatically reduced today by improved wastewater treatment. Gaining knowledge of the catchment characteristics that influence external P-loading should enable predictions of the achievable water quality of lakes. In this study, we tested this proposition. Data from 90 new Danish lakes show no apparent relationship between the mean summer P-concentration and the size or land use of the catchments. The external P-loading and resulting annual P-concentration were further investigated on a representative subset of 12 of the new lakes, using six methods. Three of the methods used empirical estimates of P-transport from catchments, based on the national average P-transport, runoff-dependent P-transport, and crop-dependent P-transport, and the other three methods used different empirical models tested on the lakes. External P-loading was reliably predicted by several of the methods. The predictions of the annual P-concentration were highly dependent on the inclusion of annual runoff. However, the predicted P-concentrations were generally overestimated, most pronounced for the nutrient-poor and most recently established lakes. In these lakes, internal P-loading was found to be the most important factor in predicting achievable water quality.					; Baastrup-Spohr, Lars/K-4696-2014; Søndergaard, Martin/P-2417-2019; Sondergaard, Martin/P-2417-2019; Hoffmann, Carl/B-6714-2011	Egemose, Sara/0000-0001-7356-9095; Martinsen, Kenneth Thoro/0000-0001-8064-513X; Baastrup-Spohr, Lars/0000-0001-8382-984X; Petersen, Anja Svane/0000-0003-3178-2845; Kragh, Theis/0000-0002-9760-2571; Jensen, Thor/0000-0002-0480-8141; Sondergaard, Martin/0000-0002-1514-0482; 														2073-4441				APR	2022	14	7							1008	10.3390/w14071008	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w14071008													WOS:000781114000001
J	Maliva, RG; Knoll, AH; Simonson, BM				Maliva, RG; Knoll, AH; Simonson, BM			Secular change in the Precambrian silica cycle: Insights from chert petrology	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN												Chert deposits preserve a record of secular change in the oceanic silica cycle. The evolutionary radiation of silica-secreting organisms resulted in a transition from abiological silica deposition, characteristic of the Archean and Proterozoic eons, to the predominantly biologically controlled silica deposition of the Phanerozoic. Comparative petrography of Phanerozoic and Precambrian cherts indicates that an earlier change in chert deposition occurred toward the end of the Paleoproterozoic era (ca. 1.8 Ga). In Neoproterozoic and Mesoproterozoic strata, early diagenetic chertification is largely restricted to peritidal environments. These early diagenetic cherts typically occur as nodules or discontinuous beds within carbonate deposits that have similar depositional textures. The cherts formed primarily by carbonate replacement with subsidiary direct silica precipitation. Some of the Paleoproterozoic cherts associated with iron formations, however, are distinctly different from younger cherts and appear to have formed largely by direct silica precipitation at or just below the seabed. These primary cherts lack ghosts or inclusions of carbonate precursors, have fine-scale grain fracturing (possibly from syneresis), exhibit low grain-packing densities, and are not associated with unsilicified carbonate deposits of similar depositional composition. Cherts in some Paleoproterozoic iron formations (e.g., the Gunflint Formation, northwestern Lake Superior region) are composed of silica types similar to those in Phanerozoic sinters (e.g., the Devonian Rhynie and Windyfield cherts, Scotland). Such cherts may provide evidence that basinal, and perhaps global, oceanic silica concentrations were higher during the Paleoproterozoic era than at later times.																			0016-7606	1943-2674				JUL-AUG	2005	117	7-8					835	845		10.1130/B25555.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/B25555.1													WOS:000229991100001

The following compounds were investigated: hexanal, heptanal, 2t,4t-heptadienal, 2t,4t-octadienal, 2t,6t-nonadienal, 2t,6c-nonadienal, 2-methylisoborneol (MIB), 2t,4t-nonadienal, beta-cyclocitral, 2t,4t-decadienal, geosmin and beta-ionone. Headspace solid-phase microextraction (SPME) coupled with gas chromatography (GC) and low-resolution ion-trap mass spectrometry (ITMS) was used for quantification of these compounds. A 65-mum polydimethylsiloxane/divinylbenzene (PDMS/DVB) fibre was used for headspace SPME analysis. Method detection limits for all compounds analyzed are at the ng/L level and are lower in most cases than sensory analysis can detect. The method was employed for the analysis of lake and reservoir water samples from several coastal British Columbia drinking water sources during the summer of 2001. Geosmin was the only compound detected and was found at concentrations up to 26 ng/L. To our knowledge the method presented is unique in terms of full automation and represents a sensitive and efficient tool for studying and monitoring taste and odour compounds in water sources.

J	LITAOR, MI				LITAOR, MI			THE INFLUENCE OF SOIL INTERSTITIAL WATERS ON THE PHYSICOCHEMISTRY OF MAJOR, MINOR AND TRACE-METALS IN STREAM WATERS OF THE GREEN LAKES VALLEY, FRONT RANGE, COLORADO	EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS												The influence of soil interstitial waters on the physicochemical characteristics of major, minor and trace metals in stream waters of an alpine watershed, Front Range, Colorado was assessed. Dissolution of Ca-aluminosilicate minerals, ion exchange reactions and the magnitude of solute flux within the alpine soil environment account for most of the observed concentrations of major, minor and trace metals in the alpine stream waters. The rate of mineral dissolution and magnitude of solute flux during the summer of 1989 was greatly affected by anthropogenic disturbance which resulted in large amounts of colloidal material and freshly exposed mineral surfaces. The alpine ecosystem responded very quickly to this disturbance. The magnitude of solute flux in the soil environment was also highly dependent on the duration and intensity of rain events, as well as the location of the site along the slope. Transport of most trace metals in the stream waters was achieved by adsorption onto colloidal surfaces of Al Si hydroxides smaller than 0.45 mum.																			0197-9337					SEP	1993	18	6					489	504		10.1002/esp.3290180603	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/esp.3290180603													WOS:A1993LW72200002

Summer samples of the euphotic zones of nine ultraoligotrophic lakes located in different drainage basins between 40 degrees 27' and 42 degrees 49'S in the North Andean Patagonia were analyzed for relative diversity by denaturating gradient gel electrophoresis and the bacterial morphology (free-living cocci and rods vs. filamentous forms) in relation to environmental factors (UVR, photosynthetically active radiation, temperature, nutrients, nanoflagellates, and ciliate abundances). The overall bacterial community composition was similar in all lakes and over depth in each lake. In contrast, the relative proportion of filaments to total bacterial biovolume was higher in the upper layers, which have higher UVR intensities (305-340 nm). Lakes with lower K-d305 (diffuse extinction coefficient, 305 nm) showed a greater proportion of filaments. Filament mean length in the upper layers was also significantly greater than at deeper levels. There was a significant correlation between UVR and filament proportion, whereas neither nanopredator abundances (nanoflagellates and ciliates), nor predation pressure, nor resources (dissolved nutrients) could explain the high proportion of filamentation in the near-surface layers. We propose that UVR plays a decisive role stimulating bacterial filamentation, particularly in lakes with high UVR penetration.

Phytoplankton data from a group of seven lakes sampled in the mid-1970's or early 1980's and in the mid-1980's were analyzed for evidence of temporal change. In both data sets, factors related to trophic status and acidification status were inferred to be important controlling variables. For example, desmid genera fell into two general groupings, one typical of clear-water, nutrient-poor, low-alkalinity lakes (e.g. species of Micrasterias, Bambusina, Euastrum, Spondylosium) and the other representing lakes higher in nutrients and alkalinity (e.g. species of Teilingia, Closterium, Xanthidium, Staurastrum). This latter group also included several chlorophytes (Ulothrix, Schroederia, Scenedesmus) and euglenoids (Euglena, Phacus). Well-defined relationships existed between lake alkalinity, pH, and total numbers of phytoplankton taxa. The smaller data set included lakes subjected to recent decreases in acid deposition and corresponding increases in pH over a 10-yr interval, and the increased numbers of phytoplankton taxa were indicative of recovery from earlier acidification.

All physics configurations have been employed to downscale multiple distinct Community Earth System Model, version 1 (CESM1), simulations driven by the representative concentration pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5) radiative forcing scenario, spanning a range from moderate (2045-60) to considerable (2085-2100) climate change. Independent of the physics configuration employed, all projected future precipitation changes are characterized by a general increase and a fattening of the tail of the daily rainfall distribution by the end of the century. The fattening of the tail can however be masked by natural variability in the case of the moderate warming expected by midcentury. The heavy-rainfall-derived precipitation increase is projected to be larger than or equal to the Clausius-Clapeyron thermodynamic reference of 7% increase per degree Celsius of surface warming, whereas the increase of average-rainfall-based precipitation becomes limited only for the largest global warming projections. This limitation is dramatically illustrated in one physics configuration at the end of the century. By downscaling the results obtained from the initial-condition ensemble, it is demonstrated that the extreme drying of the Great Lakes basin region characteristic of the most extreme end member of the CESM1 ensemble is significantly modified by downscaling with the version of WRF coupled to the Freshwater Lake model (FLake) of lake processes. This result does, however, depend upon the physics configuration employed in WRF for the parameterization of processes that cannot be explicitly resolved.

J	NIKLAS, KJ				NIKLAS, KJ			DIFFERENTIAL PRESERVATION OF PROTOPLASM IN FOSSIL ANGIOSPERM LEAF TISSUES	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Examination of Miocene angiosperm leaf compressions from the Clarkia and Succor Creek localities of Idaho and Oregon [USA] revealed a characteristic and predictable pattern of protoplasmic deterioration. Remnants of chloroplasts were preserved in 63.9% of the 8800 randomly selected cells, while mitochondria (18.6%) and nuclei (11.3%) were less commonly preserved. This pattern appeared to be independent of the presumed environment of deposition associated with fossilization. Leaf tissues from sediments thought to be derived from shallow and deeper waters of the Miocene Clarkia lake showed similar patterns of ultrastructural preservation to leaves preserved in volcanic ash-fall deposits. Analyses of the data for the relative abundance of various organelles per cell in fossil tissues and referabe modern taxa indicated that the chances of the observed preferential degradation of nuclei being the results of chance is < 0.001. The pattern of protoplasmic degeneration, reconstructed from the frequencies of organelle preservation, is in contrast to that of the pattern observed in modern plant cell necrosis or senescence where nuclei are the most stable organelle and persist until the death of the cell. Apparently, regimes of dehydration and compression may duplicate the pattern of protoplasmic degeneration observed in fossil plant cells.

This study was designed to evaluate the incidence of acute mountain sickness (AMS) occurring on different climbing routes on Mount Damavand and the effect of beginning time of ascent in Iranian trekkers. Methods. This study was a descriptive cohort investigation, performed in summer 2007. All trekkers who ascended Mount Damavand from northern, western, eastern, and southern paths and passed 4200m altitude were included in the study. Two questionnaires were completed for each trekker (personal information and Lake Louise score questionnaire). Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to explore the independent predicting variables for AMS. Results. Overall incidence rate of AMS was 53.6%. This rate was the highest in south route (61.5%) (P < 0.001). There was no difference in the incidence of AMS on other paths. AMS history, AMS history on Damavand, the beginning time of climbing, sleeping at 4200 m altitude, and home altitude had significant effect on AMS incidence, but by multiple logistic regression analysis south route and AMS history on Mount Damavand had positive effect on incidence of AMS (P = 0.019 and P < 0.001). Conclusion. The path and the beginning time of ascent can affect incidence of AMS. The risk of occurrence of AMS was 1.9 times as large for trekkers who ascended from southern route.					; Ziaee, Vahid/E-2786-2014; Mansournia, Mohammad/AFA-8899-2022	Mansournia, Mohammad Ali/0000-0003-3343-2718; Ziaee, Vahid/0000-0003-4648-3573; 													2090-1852	2090-1860					2012	2012								428296	10.1155/2012/428296	http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2012/428296								22530120					WOS:000215747800017

The chronology is based on 11 calibrated radiocarbon dates on terrestrial plant macrofossils suggesting a basal age of 14,200 cal. BP. Pollen and macrofossil data imply that treeline never reached the lake catchment during the BOlling-AllerOd interstadial. Treeline north of the Alps was depressed by c. 300 altitudinal meters, if compared with southern locations. We attribute this difference to colder temperatures and to unbuffered cold air excursions from the ice masses in northern Europe. Afforestation started after the Younger Dryas at 11,600 cal. BP. Early-Holocene tree-Betula and Pinus sylvestris forests were replaced by Abies alba forests around 7500 cal. BP. Continuous high-resolution pollen and macrofossil series allow quantitative assessments of vegetation dynamics at 5900-5200 cal. BP (first expansion of Picea abies, decline of Abies alba) and 4100-2900 cal. BP (first collapse of Abies alba). The first signs of human activity became noticeable during the late Neolithic c. 5700-5200 cal. BP. Cross-correlation analysis shows that the expansion of Alnus viridis and the replacement of Abies alba by Picea abies after c. 5500 cal. BP was most likely a consequence of human disturbance. Abies alba responded very sensitively to a combination of fire and grazing disturbance. Our results imply that the current dominance of Picea abies in the upper montane and subalpine belts is a consequence of anthropogenic activities through the millennia.					; Schworer, Christoph/P-3488-2016; Col, Dan/A-2851-2009; Tinner, Willy/F-6727-2013; Schwörer, Christoph/P-3488-2016	Rey, Fabian/0000-0002-0737-3921; Colombaroli, Daniele/0000-0002-9632-2009; Schworer, Christoph/0000-0002-8884-8852; Tinner, Willy/0000-0001-7352-0144; 													0959-6836	1477-0911				OCT	2013	23	10					1415	1427		10.1177/0959683613489585	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683613489585													WOS:000325710400005

Microbial contamination in groundwater supply in a cold climate and coarse soil: case study of norovirus outbreak at Lake Myvatn, Iceland	HYDROLOGY RESEARCH												This paper explores the fate and transport of microbial contamination in a cold climate and coarse aquifers. A confirmed norovirus outbreak in a small rural water supply in the late summer of 2004, which is estimated to have infected over 100 people, is used as a case study. A septic system, 80 m upstream of the water intake, is considered to have contaminated drinking water. Water samples tested were negative for coliform and strongly positive for norovirus. Modelling predicts that a 4.8-log(10) removal was possible in the 8 m thick vadose zone, while only a 0.7-log(10) and 2.7-log(10) removal in the aquifer for viruses and Escherichia coli, respectively. The model results support that the 80 m setback distance was inadequate and roughly 900 m aquifer transport distance was needed to achieve 9-log(10) viral removal. Sensitivity analysis showed that the most influential parameters on model transport removal rate are grain size diameter and groundwater velocity, temperature and acidity. The results demonstrate a need for systematic evaluation of septic systems in rural areas in lesser studied coarse strata at low temperatures, thereby strengthening data used for regulatory requirements for more confident determination on safe setback distances.

Prescribed burn smoke impact in the Lake Tahoe Basin: model simulation and field verification	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENT AND POLLUTION												Smoke dispersion modelling based on the Fire Emission Production Simulator and the Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (FEPS-HYSPLIT) model was applied to prescribed burns in the Lake Tahoe Basin (LTB) during fall 2011. This, in conjunction with measurements at sources and real-time ambient PM2.5 monitoring around LTB, served to evaluate the prescribed burning impacts on air quality. For a given combustion efficiency, in-plume measurements suggest FEPS to underestimate PM2.5 emission factors by up to six-fold, though FEPS agrees relatively well with laboratory combustion of dry fuels. Prescribed burns in LTB were mostly < 100 acres; time series analysis and model prediction (with 2 km or 12 km spatial resolution) suggest generally small effects on PM2.5 exposure of local communities due to careful selection of the burn windows. In regard to a few scenarios where significant impact (>= 2 mu g/m(3) hourly) is predicted, the model with 2 km resolution shows smoke arrival times more consistent with ambient observations. However, uncertainties in the model predictions should be reduced further by acquiring more accurate burn records and measuring markers specific to biomass burning at the monitoring sites.

J	CLAIR, TA				CLAIR, TA			ACID PRECIPITATION AND WEATHERING BY ORGANIC-ACIDS IN LABRADOR LAKE BASINS	WATER RESOURCES BULLETIN												Thirty-five lakes in southern Labrador sampled in 1981 were resampled in 1989 and water chemistry values were compared between visits. Results showed higher pH, specific conductance, acid neutralization capacity, color, and base cations values in 1989, though sulfate, the ion most likely to reflect acid precipitation impacts, did not vary. The major ion changes measured were probably due to natural hydrological variations and not to changes in acid inputs. Results from the 1989 data showed a slight, but significant, decrease in water sulfate concentration trend from western to eastern Labrador, though most values, even in the western portion of the study area, fell close to the values considered "background" by Brakke et al. (1989). Base cation concentrations exceeded those which could be predicted from weathering by carbonic and bicarbonic acid. Assuming that little weathering is generated by acid precipitation in this region, the excess cations measured are probably a result of bedrock dissolution from organic acids generated by plant decomposition. Calculations showed that organic acid effect could be responsible for 9 to 52 percent of total weathering in the study basins.																			0043-1370					MAY-JUN	1992	28	3					507	515																WOS:A1992JR19400006

The lake faces significant challenges due to changes in land use and climate. This study used multi-source remote sensing data in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform to create Land Use and Land Cover (LULC), land surface temperature (LST), and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) layers in the period 2000-2023 to understand the impact of LULC and climate change on Lake Victoria Basin. The land use/land cover trends before 2020 indicated an increase in the urban areas from 0.13% in 2000 to 0.16% in 2020. Croplands increased from 6.51% in 2000 to 7.88% in 2020. The water surface area averaged 61,559 square km, which has increased since 2000 with an average rate of 1.3%. The "Permanent Wetland" size change from 2000 to 2020 varied from 1.70% to 1.83%. Cropland/Natural Vegetation Mosaics rose from 12.77% to 15.01%, through 2000 to 2020. However, more than 29,000 residents were displaced in mid-2020 as the water increased by 1.21 m from the fall of 2019 to the middle of 2020.

Distribution and Contamination Status of Trace Metals in the Mediterranean Coastal Sediments, Egypt	SOIL & SEDIMENT CONTAMINATION												Trace metals concentrations in sediments from the Egyptian Mediterranean coast were determined to evaluate the levels of contamination. The highest concentrations of metals were generally found in the middle region of the coast. Sediment pollution assessment was carried out using Enrichment Factor (EF), Geoaccumulation Factor (Igeo), Contamination Factor (CF), Modified Degree of Contamination (mCd), and Pollution Load Index (PLI). Association of adverse effects to aquatic life was determined using the classification of sediments according to three sets of sediment quality guidelines. The mean EF values were found to fall in the following sequence: Cr > Pb > Ni > Zn > Cu > Mn. The results demonstrated that the EF of metals in the sediments of the middle region was lower than those recorded in the western region and Rafah Station at the eastern region; the difference in the EF levels was significantly correlated with Fe concentrations along the study area. Based on the average Igeo of target elements, the Egyptian Mediterranean coast could be considered not polluted with Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn (Igeo 0). The modified degree of contamination was >1.5, indicating zero to very low contamination. The calculated PLI were less than 1, indicating only baseline levels of pollution. There were small differences between the results obtained with the three used SQGs. Highly significant correlations were found between the concentrations of Fe, Mn, Co, Cr, and Ni, suggesting similar sources and/or similar geochemical processes controlling the occurrence of these metals in the sediments.

Alkalinity in the bottom layer at the deepest point of the pond increased in summer, but in-pond generation of alkalinity was estimated to be very small because of the low depth of water in the pond. According to the calculations of water budget and solute balance, subsurface water, the alkalinity of which is moderately high, accounted for 45% of the total influx during a period of relatively high water level. The predicted concentrations of major ions and alkalinity in the pond calculated from the mass balance coincided well with measured concentrations. The relatively high pH values of the pond water during a period of high water level are considered to be mainly caused by alkalinity supplied by influxes, especially subsurface water. During a period of relatively low water level, predicted alkalinity exceeded measured alkalinity by 29%, indicating the occurrence of in-pond consumption of alkalinity with a resultant decrease in pH.																			1439-8621	1439-863X				APR	2005	6	1					15	26		10.1007/s10201-004-0140-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10201-004-0140-7													WOS:000228456000003

Females and males of the first three postembryonic instars can be identified by the different number of setae and setal rudiments on the proximal and distal segments of the exopodite of the swimming antennae: 3 + 7; (i + 3) + 7; 4 + (i + 7), respectively (i = rudiment of seta). The subsequent instars have 4 + 8 long plumose setae on these segments, but the fourth instar has the proximal lateral seta of the distal exopod segment slightly shorter and thinner than the others. The antennules and copulatory appendages of males are instar-specific. Diaphanosomas show small increments in body length during the postembryonic molts. The largest increments (about 115 mu m) occur during the first or second molts. The allometric equation of Huxley (1924) was used for a comparison of the relative growth rate of different body parts. In the middle of summer, the head and swimming antennae with the body and the antennal exopodite with the antennal basipodite grow in isometry. At the same time, the branches of the swimming antennae and their setae show allometric growth: the exopodite and distal setae grow faster than the endopodite and the lateral setae, respectively.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				MAR 15	2005	537						7	14		10.1007/s10750-004-1570-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-004-1570-2													WOS:000230589900002

Acidic alteration and high-temperature hot springs surround several Quaternary volcanoes within the Sengan area. Quaternary intrusive granitic-dioritic rocks are distributed beneath the Kakkonda, Matsukawa, and Matsuo-Hachimantai geothermal fields. In particular, the Kakkonda granite, a heat source in the Kakkonda geothermal field, has a high temperature exceeding 500 degrees C inside the body. The temperature structure of the Sengan area was investigated using temperature logging data (WD-1a and 53 wells) collected as part of the temperature recovery test conducted in the geothermal wells. The temperature structure was estimated based on temperature extrapolation, a 2-D temperature distribution created with the thin-plate spline method, and a 3-D temperature distribution obtained by combining the horizontal 2-D temperature data. High-temperature zones above 200 degrees C are distributed at sea level in Nyuto (eastern Lake Tazawa), Kakkonda, Matsukawa, Matsuo-Hachimantai (Hachimantai), and Mt. Akita-Yakeyama, as predicted using the temperature structure estimation method. The granitic-dioritic magma penetrates the pre-Tertiary basement units and the Neogene beneath several fields to form a high-temperature zone in the shallow depth, contributing to the formation of geothermal systems in the Sengan area. However, the linear extrapolation of the subsurface temperature tended to over-estimate the temperature in the greater depth and was valid only at a depth shallower than 3 or 4 km below sea level. This study delineated several high-temperature zones exceeding 200 degrees C above sea level in the Sengan area.

Low purification efficiency in winter is a common problem in high-altitude wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), and analysis of the microbial community involved in the sewage treatment process at high-altitude can provide valuable references for improving this problem. Methods: In this study, the bacterial communities of high- and low-altitude WWTPs were investigated using Illumina high-throughput sequencing (HTS). The interaction between microbial community and environmental variables were explored by co-occurrence correlation network. Results: At genus level, Thauera (5.2%), unclassified_Rhodocyclaceae (3.0%), Dokdonella (2.5%), and Ferribacterium (2.5%) were the dominant genera in high-altitude group. The abundance of nitrogen and phosphorus removal bacteria were higher in high-altitude group (10.2% and 1.3%, respectively) than in low-altitude group (5.4% and 0.6%, respectively). Redundancy analysis (RDA) and co-occurrence network analysis showed that altitude, ultraviolet index (UVI), pH, dissolved oxygen (DO) and total nitrogen (TN) were the dominated environmental factors (p < 0.05) affecting microbial community assembly, and these five variables explained 21.4%, 20.3%, 16.9%, 11.5%, and 8.2% of the bacterial assembly of AS communities. Discussion: The community diversity of high-altitude group was lower than that of low-altitude group, and WWTPs of high-altitude aeras had a unique microbial community structure. Low temperature and strong UVI are pivotal factors contributing to the reduced diversity of activated sludge microbial communities at high-altitudes.																			2296-4185					FEB 27	2023	11								1107633	10.3389/fbioe.2023.1107633	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fbioe.2023.1107633								36923457					WOS:000948672300001
J	Long, H; Lai, ZP; Wang, NA; Li, Y				Long, Hao; Lai, ZhongPing; Wang, NaiAng; Li, Yu			Holocene climate variations from Zhuyeze terminal lake records in East Asian monsoon margin in arid northern China	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												Zhuyeze palaeolake is a terminal lake situated in the arid northern China in the East Asian monsoon margin. In order to examine the Holocene palaeoclimatic change in the East Asian monsoon margin, Qingtu Lake section (QTL) from Zhuyeze palaeolake is sampled in high resolution. Palaeoclimatic proxies such as grain size, carbonate, TOC, C/N and delta C-13 of organic matter, were analyzed; eleven C-14 samples and six optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) samples were dated to provide chronological control. We also investigated the geomorphic features of lake shorelines in this area. The results show that the climate was warm and dry in early-Holocene (9.5-7.0 cal ka BP), cool and humid in mid-Holocene (7.0-4.8 cal ka BP), and increasingly drier in late-Holocene (since 4.8 cal ka BP). Comparisons of our records with other records in adjacent areas, as well as with the records in the Asian monsoon areas, suggested that changes in effective moisture was synchronous in East Asian monsoon marginal zone (i.e. the pattern of dry early-Holocene, humid mid-Holocene, and aridity-increasing late-Holocene), and that the moisture optimum during the Holocene was out-of-phase between Asian monsoon margin and Asian monsoonal dominated region, possibly due to the high temperature at that time.

J	Dresti, C; Rogora, M; Fenocchi, A				Dresti, Claudia; Rogora, Michela; Fenocchi, Andrea			Hypolimnetic oxygen depletion in a deep oligomictic lake under climate change	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration is a fundamental metric to describe climate-related alterations in deep lakes. Increasing water temperatures enhance thermal stratification, leading in temperate basins to a growing isolation of deep waters. This leads to the depletion of hypolimnetic DO, which adds up to limited nutrient circulation and restricted replenishment of the trophogenic layers. With vanishing convective mixing, it is commonly believed that the only source of hypolimnetic DO replenishment will be represented by deep intrusions of cold oxygenated waters from the tributaries. In this study, we first analyse the 1993-2020 long-term observed trends of DO concentrations in the subalpine deep oligomictic Lake Maggiore (Italy/Switzerland). Then, through an algorithm calculating daily intrusion depths and mass discharges of DO for the major tributaries, we show that deep insertions are suppressed for increasing winter water temperatures and residual thermal stratification. Turbulent entrainment is proved fundamental for DO replenishment, leading to mass discharges of DO released into the deep hypolimnion up to more than two orders of magnitude larger than the original ones from the tributaries. Last, we discuss the results of simulations made through a one-dimensional coupled ecological-hydrodynamic model about the possible effects of a full turnover on DO concentrations in the deep hypolimnion. Two cases are displayed, with the turnover taking place either now or with an anoxic hypolimnion deriving from decades of isolation due to severe climate warming. Through this study, climate warming is shown to be a fundamental driver of DO in Lake Maggiore, its depletion harming both water quality and the ecosystem.

Climate variability along the margin of the southern African monsoon region at the end of the African Humid Period	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Evidence for climate variability in the southern African monsoon region (SAMR) is limited by a spatially and temporally discontinuous palaeoclimatic dataset. We describe a 6680 year long, largely sub-decadal resolution delta N-15 record from a rock hyrax midden from southeastern Africa. The results provide a detailed reconstruction of regional hydroclimates since the beginning of the mid-Holocene. A long-term albeit - subtle - increase in humidity consistent with precessional forcing is observed, but the record is dominated by a strong similar to 1750-yr cycle, a signal that is shared with other SAMR records. Considered in their regional context, these data suggest that changes coincident with the termination of the African Humid Period at similar to 5500 cal BP do not express the abrupt transition observed in some records from the northern African tropics. Rather they indicate gradual changes, as observed at peri-equatorial sites. Notably, however, eastern and western subregions of the SAMR experience a rapid phase shift beginning similar to 5500 cal BP, with initially in-phase hydroclimate anomalies transitioning to the establishment of a strong east-west dipole. This likely reflects a coeval strengthening of the Southeast Atlantic trade winds and decreased atmospheric pressure in southeast Africa, factors associated with increasing (decreasing) austral (boreal) summer insolation. The results highlight the distinct nature of southern African responses across this key period of African climate history. (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Tlili, F; Ayari, A; Regaya, K				Tlili, Faouzia; Ayari, Asma; Regaya, Kamel			Sedimentary characteristics and depositional environment of quaternary lacustrine tufa Bent Jedidi spring systems, NE Tunisia	CARBONATES AND EVAPORITES												The carbonate Bent Jedidi unit represents Middle-Late Pleistocene continental carbonate deposits in Northeastern Tunisia. The unit consists of three main asymmetrically distributed facies associations: palustrine carbonates, lacustrine carbonates, and tufa carbonate. This study evaluates the variations in their petrographic properties. The transition from alluvial environments to lake margins settings displays a shift from conglomerate and silt to lacustrine-palustrine mudstones to packstones. The palustrine carbonates include features such as pseudo-microkarst, root cavities, gypsum, nodular and mottled limestone that indicates a semi-arid climate with water level fluctuations. Lacustrine deposits contain charophytes, gastropods and ostracods, oncoids coated by iron oxide cement, oncoliths, and recrystallization of calcite which confirms that the lacustrine facies were deposited in shallow freshwater within a sub-humid climate. Tufa facies is represented by many sequences showing the alternation of marl/tufa or silt/tufa facies associations typified as a fluvial tufa barrage. Microscopic observations show four microfacies: porous tufa, algae filaments, moss tufa, and cyanobacterial tufa. These meteogene tufas are formed in a cool temperate climate. In the Bent Jedidi basin, the evaluation of facies associations along profiles indicates a significant impact of water level fluctuation on the formation of carbonate deposits formation.																			0891-2556	1878-5212				JUN	2023	38	2							46	10.1007/s13146-023-00870-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13146-023-00870-0													WOS:000969765200002

Historical pattern of phosphorus loading to Lake Erie watersheds	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Phosphorus (P) applied to croplands in excess of crop requirements has resulted in large-scale accumulation of P in soils worldwide, leading to freshwater eutrophication from river runoff that may extend well into the future. However, several studies have reported declines in surplus P inputs to the land in recent decades. To quantify trends in P loading to Lake Erie (LE) watersheds, we estimated net anthropogenic phosphorus inputs (NAPI) to 18 LE watersheds for agricultural census years from 1935 to 2007. NAPI quantifies anthropogenic inputs of P from fertilizer use, atmospheric deposition and detergents, as well as the net exchange in P related to trade in food and feed. Over this 70-year period, NAPI increased to peak values in the 1970s and subsequently declined in 2007 to a level last experienced in 1935. This rise and fall was the result of two trends: a dramatic increase in fertilizer use, which peaked in the 1970s and then declined to about two-thirds of maximum values; and a steady increase in P exported as crops destined for animal feed and energy production. During 1974-2007, riverine phosphorus loads fluctuated, and were correlated with inter-annual variation in water discharge. However, riverine P export did not show consistent temporal trends, nor correlate with temporal trends in NAPI or fertilizer use. The fraction of P inputs exported by rivers appeared to increase sharply after the 1990s, but the cause is unknown. Thus estimates of phosphorus inputs to watersheds provide insight into changing source quantities but may be weak predictors of riverine export.

J	Ortega-Guerrero, B; García, LC; Linares-López, C				Ortega-Guerrero, Beatriz; Caballero Garcia, Lizeth; Linares-Lopez, Carlos			Tephrostratigraphy of the late Quaternary record from Lake Chalco, central Mexico	JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES												Lacustrine sequences in active volcanic settings preserve the record of fall-out products (tephras) from explosive volcanic activity from both proximal and distal sources. Sediments of Lake Chalco, located in the western part of the Trans Mexican Volcanic Belt, offer the opportunity to develop a detailed tephrostratigraphy of proximal and distal sources, and to provide stratigraphic marker horizons for the correlation of paleoclimate records. Here, we present major oxide glass and pumice data from 18 tephra layers interbedded in the lacustrine sediments of Chalco, from 11.5 to 31.3 cal ka BP. Tephra glass compositions range from basaltic trachyandesitic to rhyolitic. Two tephras were successfully correlated with the Tutti Frutti Plinian Eruption of Popocateped volcano; and two tephra layers from the Nevado de Toluca Plinian activity: the Upper Toluca Pumice and the Lower Toluca Pumice. Although the source of most of the tephras analyzed is unknown, their geochemical characterization, coupled with a robust chronology, contributes to establish a detailed tephrostratigraphy for the region. This tephra record also contributes to improving the estimated frequency of explosive volcanic activity for future hazards in the Basin of Mexico and surrounding areas, where more than 29 million people live. Our findings estimate a recurrence interval of volcanic activity of ca. 1100 years in the interval between ca. 32 and 11.5 cal ka BP, shorter than previously estimated. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In the final section with the highest population density, the stream is channeled, and this is the most waterproofed part of the watershed, without any riparian forest, and surrounded by one of the biggest avenues of the metropolitan city of Porto Alegre. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the spatial variability of the sediment pollution, by potentially toxic metals and macronutrients, from the source to the mouth of Diluvio Stream. Sediment samples were collected in 15 sites, along the entire course of the Diluvio Stream-from its springs to its mouth (18 km). We evaluated the pH, bulk density, grain size, electrical conductivity, total organic carbon (TOC), total phosphorus (P), inorganic P and organic P, total nitrogen (N), and pseudototal elements (Fe, Al, Ca, Mg, Na, K, Mn, Ba, Zn, Pb, Cu, Cr, Ni, Cd). The sediments of Diluvio Stream are predominantly sandy, with higher pollution in the sites with smaller particles and more organic carbon, increasing levels of metals and phosphorus to the Lake Guaiba. The pollution increases from its sources to its mouth, with an anthropogenic origin linked to the releases of wastewater and sewage, the large waterproofed area, the lack of riparian forest, and the large flow of vehicles near to the watercourse. Values of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus indicate that most of this derive from anthropogenic activities (as sewage), carrying other pollutants together-such as potentially toxic metals (especially Zn, Cu, and Pb).					; Capeleto de Andrade, Leonardo/J-2420-2016; Santos, Vinicius/KXQ-9832-2024; Camargo, Flavio/J-6914-2013	camargo, flavio/0000-0003-1080-0549; Capeleto de Andrade, Leonardo/0000-0002-9902-0532; 													0049-6979	1573-2932				MAR 26	2020	231	4							156	10.1007/s11270-020-04504-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-020-04504-2													WOS:000521738500001

This result showed that the cyanobacterial bloom might cause nitrate depletion in an aquatic ecosystem. To further investigate this field result, nitrate transformations after the addition of cyanobacteria collected from Lake Taihu were traced in laboratory microcosms with the N-15 isotope addition method. About 81.2% and 98.4% of nitrate was lost when 2 x 10(9) and 4 x 10(9) cells L-1 of cyanobacteria were added, respectively. The nitrate concentration decrease followed first-order kinetics with the rate constant 0.23 and 1.41 d(-1) in the two treatments, respectively. Conventional denitrification was found to play a major role in the nitrate removal process while other pathways (e.g., dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium [DNRA] and assimilation of nitrate into microbial biomass) were negligible. It was likely that the cyanobacterial respiration as well as their decomposition resulted in anoxic conditions and that cyanobacteria also served as a carbon source for denitrification. Based on the above results, it was estimated that 10(9) cells of cyanobacteria were enough for denitrifiers to remove 0.53 mmol nitrate in the eutrophic lake ecosystem. Therefore, cyanobacterial blooms have the potential for nitrogen removal by denitrification and this process could cause nitrogen limitation of primary production in summer in Lake Taihu. This interactive relationship of nitrogen and cyanobacteria potentially constitutes a negative feedback for mitigating cyanobacterial blooms in this eutrophic lake environment.

Airborne and spaceborne DEM- and laser altimetry-derived surface elevation and volume changes of the Bering Glacier system, Alaska, USA, and Yukon, Canada, 1972-2006	JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY												Using airborne and spaceborne high-resolution digital elevation models and laser altimetry, we present estimates of interannual and multi-decadal surface elevation changes on the Bering Glacier system, Alaska, USA, and Yukon, Canada, from 1972 to 2006. We find: (1) the rate of lowering during 1972-95 was 0.9 +/- 0.1 m a(-1); (2) this rate accelerated to 3.0 +/- 0.7 m a(-1) during 1995-2000; and (3) during 2000-03 the lowering rate was 1.5 +/- 0.4 m a(-1). From 1972 to 2003, 70% of the area of the system experienced a volume loss of 191 +/- 17 km(3), which was an area-average surface elevation lowering of 1.7 +/- 0.2 m a(-1). From November 2004 to November 2006, surface elevations across Bering Glacier, from McIntosh Peak on the south to Waxell Ridge on the north, rose as much as 53 m. Up-glacier on Bagley Ice Valley about 10 km east of juniper Island nunatak, surface elevations lowered as much as 28 m from October 2003 to October 2006. NASA Terra/MODIS observations from May to September 2006 indicated muddy outburst floods from the Bering terminus into Vitus Lake.

We used a metagenomic approach that entailed obtaining the whole genome sequence of a verrucomicrobiotal methanotroph from a microbial consortium enriched from samples obtained from Nymph Lake (89.9 degrees C, pH 2.73) in Yellowstone National Park in the USA. To identify and reconstruct the verrucomicrobiotal genome from Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencing data, we constructed a bioinformatic pipeline with various combinations of de novo assembly, alignment, and binning algorithms. Based on the marker gene (pmoA), we identified and assembled the Candidatus Methylacidiphilum sp. YNP IV genome (2.47 Mbp, 2392 ORF, and 41.26% GC content). In a comparison of average nucleotide identity between Ca. Methylacidiphilum sp. YNP IV and Ca. Methylacidiphilum fumariolicum SolV, its closest 16S rRNA gene sequence relative, is lower than 95%, suggesting that Ca. Methylacidiphilum sp. YNP IV can be regarded as a different species. The Ca. Methylacidiphilum sp. YNP IV genome assembly showed most of the key genes for methane metabolism, the CBB pathway for CO2 fixation, nitrogen fixation and assimilation, hydrogenases, and rare earth elements transporter, as well as defense mechanisms. The assembly and reconstruction of a thermoacidophilic methanotroph belonging to the Verrucomicrobiota phylum from a geothermal environment adds further evidence and knowledge concerning the diversity of biological methane oxidation and on the adaptation of this geochemically relevant reaction in extreme environments.

J	HAVENS, KE; DECOSTA, J				HAVENS, KE; DECOSTA, J			A COMPARISON OF PHYTOPLANKTON RESPONSES TO NUTRIENT ADDITIONS IN ACIDIC AND CIRCUMNEUTRAL PH LAKEWATER	HYDROBIOLOGIA												An in situ bag experiment was conducted at circumneutral, mesotrophic Lake O''Woods, West Virginia [USA], during summer 1984. Four bags were untreated controls, while four others were gradually acidified to pH 4.5. After 35 days, the algal community in the acid bags closely resembled that of precipitation-acidified lakes in North America. On day 39, two acid and one control bag were fertilized with phosphorus (P) and nitrogen(N). In both cases, algal biomass increased. However, the maximal level reached was 350% higher in the acid plus PN treatment, where the herbivorous zooplankton density had become very low. In the control plus PN treatment, Ulothrix sp. replaced Gymnodinium sp. as the most important alga. However, in the acid plus PN treatment, Peridinium inconspicuum continued to account for ca. 50% of algal biomass until the end of the experiment, as it did in the unfertilized acid treatment. The results suggest that fertilization-induced changes in algal community structure are less pronounced in acid waters than in circumneutral ones. Differential sensitivity to the harsh environmental conditions may strongly control dominance in the acid lake phytoplankton community, regardless of nutrient status.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				JUL 30	1986	137	3					211	222		10.1007/BF00004235	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00004235													WOS:A1986D816900003

Efficiency of transfer of essential polyunsaturated fatty acids versus organic carbon from producers to consumers in a eutrophic reservoir	OECOLOGIA												One of the central paradigms of ecology is that only about 10% of organic carbon production of one trophic level is incorporated into new biomass of organisms of the next trophic level. Many of energy-yielding compounds of carbon are designated as 'essential', because they cannot be synthesized de novo by consumers and must be obtained with food, while they play important structural and regulatory functions. The question arises: are the essential compounds transferred through trophic chains with the same efficiency as bulk carbon? To answer this question, we measured gross primary production of phytoplankton and secondary production of zooplankton and content of organic carbon and essential polyunsaturated fatty acids of omega-3 family with 18-22 carbon atoms (PUFA) in the biomass of phytoplankton and zooplankton in a small eutrophic reservoir during two summers. Transfer efficiency between the two trophic levels, phytoplankton (producers) and zooplankton (consumers), was calculated as ratio of the primary production versus the secondary (zooplankton) production for both carbon and PUFA. We found that the essential PUFA were transferred from the producers to the primary consumers with about twice higher efficiency than bulk carbon. In contrast, polyunsaturated fatty acids with 16 carbon atoms, which are synthesized exclusively by phytoplankton, but are not essential for animals, had significantly lower transfer efficiency than both bulk carbon, and essential PUFA. Thus, the trophic pyramid concept, which implicitly implies that all the energy-yielding compounds of carbon are transferred from one trophic level to the next with the same efficiency of about on average 10%, should be specified for different carbon compounds.

Rotenone for exotic trout eradication: nontarget impacts on aquatic communities in a mountain lake	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Beaulieu J, Trepanier-Leroux D, Fischer JM, Olson MH, Thibodeau S, Humphries S, Fraser DJ, Derry AM. 2021. Rotenone for exotic trout eradication: nontarget impacts on aquatic communities in a mountain lake. Lake Reserv Manage. XX:XXX-XXX. Rotenone is widely used in lake and reservoir management for the eradication of exotic fish. However, nontarget effects of rotenone on freshwater organisms such as zooplankton and macroinvertebrates are of concern because of the ecological importance of these organisms in aquatic food webs as a resource base for fish, especially when rotenone is applied to lakes prior to native fish reintroduction. The objective of our study was to determine the effects of rotenone on nontarget zooplankton and macroinvertebrate species assemblages in a headwater mountain lake where rotenone was applied to remove exotic brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis; Banff, AB Canada). We found strong negative rotenone impacts on the community structure and density of crustacean zooplankton, and to a lesser extent on macroinvertebrates, lasting for at least 1 yr after the rotenone treatment. Our study offers 2 unique insights that differentiate from rotenone studies on other lakes: (1) the persistent and almost complete eradication of crustacean zooplankton in the following summers, 11 months after rotenone treatment, and (2) a considerable shift in the macroinvertebrate community composition, likely resulting from combined effects of both nontarget rotenone effects on taxon density and trophic interactions associated with the eradication of brook trout from the lake. We advocate that assisted recolonization in the restoration of aquatic food webs could play an important role in facilitating nontarget aquatic community recovery following lake rotenone treatment.					; Fraser, Dylan/X-1659-2019	Beaulieu, Julien/0000-0003-2597-8921; , Janet/0000-0002-6779-2407; Derry, Alison/0000-0001-5768-8027; Trepanier-Leroux, Daphne/0000-0002-0608-276X													1040-2381	2151-5530				AUG 26	2021	37	3					323	338		10.1080/10402381.2021.1912864	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10402381.2021.1912864		MAY 2021											WOS:000653593700001

Influence of air mass origin on aerosol properties at a remote Michigan forest site	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												The northern Great Lakes region of North America is a large, relatively pristine area. To date, there has only been limited study of the atmospheric aerosol in this region. During summer 2009, a detailed characterization of the atmospheric aerosol was conducted at the University of Michigan Biological Station (UMBS) as part of the Community Atmosphere-Biosphere Interactions Experiment (CABINEX). Measurements included particle size distribution, water-soluble composition, and CCN activity. Aerosol properties were strongly dependent on the origin of the air masses reaching the site. For similar to 60% of the study period, air was transported from sparsely populated regions to the northwest. During these times aerosol loadings were low, with mean number and volume concentrations of 1630 cm(-3) and 1.91 mu m(3) cm(-3), respectively. The aerosol during clean periods was dominated by organics, and exhibited low hygroscopicities (mean K = 0.18 at s = 0.3%). When air was from more populated regions to the east and south (similar to 29% of the time), aerosol properties reflected a stronger anthropogenic influence, with 85% greater particle number concentrations, 2.5 times greater aerosol volume, six times more sulfate mass, and increased hygroscopicity (mean K = 0.24 at s = 0.3%). These trends are have the potential to influence forest-atmosphere interactions and should be targeted for future study. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Influence of fish assemblage and shallow lake productivity on waterfowl communities in the Boreal Transition Zone of western Canada	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												P>1. Shallow lakes in the Boreal Transition Zone (BTZ) in Alberta, Canada are naturally productive systems that provide important breeding and moulting habitat for many waterfowl (Anseriformes). To examine the relative importance of biotic and abiotic factors on waterfowl population densities, species richness and community composition, we surveyed 30 shallow lakes and evaluated the relationships among fish communities, lake characteristics and waterfowl in both breeding and moulting habitat. Shallow lakes were either fishless (n = 15), contained only small-bodied fishes (n = 10) or contained large-bodied, mostly predatory, fish in addition to small-bodied fish (n = 5). 2. Environmental factors, including water colour, submerged aquatic vegetation, lake area and potassium, explained 24.3% of the variation in breeding waterfowl communities. Fish assemblage contributed independently to a small but significant proportion (13.4%) of the variation, while 13.8% of the explained variation was shared between environmental factors and fish assemblage. In total, 51.5% of the variation in breeding waterfowl communities was explained. 3. Overall, 55.5% of the total variation in moulting waterfowl communities was explained. Environment alone [especially total phosphorus, lake area, maximum depth and dissolved organic carbon (DOC)] and variation shared by fish and environment similarly accounted for most of the explained variation in moulting waterfowl communities (21.7% and 25.7% respectively), while fish assemblage was only one-third as important (8.1%). 4. Both breeding and moulting waterfowl densities increased with lake productivity, even in eutrophic and hypereutrophic lakes. Breeding waterfowl density was also twice as great in fishless lakes than in lakes with fish, after accounting for lake area. 5. Certain waterfowl taxa were linked to fishless lakes, especially in the moulting season. Canvasback and moulting ring-necked ducks were linked to small-bodied fish lakes, whereas moulting common goldeneye were indicators of large-bodied fish lakes. Knowledge of fish presence and species composition can therefore help guide conservation and management of waterfowl habitat in western Canada. Our results suggest that management efforts to maintain the most productive waterfowl habitat in the BTZ should focus on smaller, shallow, fishless lakes, particularly given that larger fish-bearing systems have greater regulatory protection.

Whether these differences were caused by a change in precipitation or other hydroclimate factors remains controversial. We selected Huahai Lake, located in the western portion of the Hexi Corridor, at the northwest margin of the Asian monsoon area, to address this question. Using paleoclimate proxies (mineralogical assemblages and immobile elements) and results from a previous study, we inferred hydroclimate changes in this area during the early and middle Holocene (10.5-5.5 cal ka BP). Heavy precipitation and abundant runoff occurred during the early Holocene (10.5-8.8 cal ka BP). Proxies (carbonate content, total organic carbon and C/N) for precipitation minus evaporation (P -E) in the same section, however, revealed low P -E during the early Holocene and highest P -E in the middle Holocene (8.8-5.5 cal ka BP). Therefore, on a millennial timescale, precipitation amount and effective moisture changes were asynchronous during the early and middle Holocene. The precipitation and effective moisture pattern in the study area during that time span was different from patterns in both the Asian monsoon and westerly wind-influenced areas, suggesting an interplay between the two climate features. High precipitation during the early Holocene corresponded to a strengthened Asian monsoon. Highest P -E in the study area occurred during the middle Holocene and may have been caused by low evaporation, rather than high precipitation.					; Li, Zhuolun/AAF-4275-2020	Li, Yu/0000-0003-3381-5372; Li, Zhuolun/0000-0003-4164-8551; 													0921-2728	1573-0417				MAR	2016	55	3					289	302		10.1007/s10933-016-9880-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-016-9880-8													WOS:000373304100007

Thermal stratification prevents the vertical transfer of heat and oxygen and deteriorates the water quality. Since North Pine Dam is a source of drinking water supply, bubble plume destratification system was chosen to counter the effects of stratification. A numerical model called Destrat was used to design a bubble plume system which destratifies the strongest observed stratification in the reservoir within 3 weeks. Field observations, however, showed that the destratification of North Pine Dam occurred slower than predicted by Destrat. Therefore Destrat was modified for future applications, by including the effect of solar radiation as a source of stratification. The Dynamic Reservoir Simulation Model (DYRESM) was then run to model the destratification of North Pine Dam. The results of this simulation were not in agreement with the field data as DYRESM overestimated the destratification caused by the bubble plume. A comparison of the field and simulated results indicated that the volume of water entrained by bubble plume in the DYRESM is overestimated. Reducing the entrainment coefficient of air bubbles produced a closer agreement between the field data and the simulation results.

J	Notaro, M; Jorns, J; Briley, L				Notaro, Michael; Jorns, Jenna; Briley, Laura			Representation of Lake-Atmosphere Interactions and Lake-Effect Snowfall in the Laurentian Great Lakes Basin among HighResMIP Global Climate Models	JOURNAL OF THE ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES												Credible modeling, tools, and guidance, regarding the changing Laurentian Great Lakes and the climatic impacts, are needed by local decision-makers to inform their management and planning. The present study addresses this need through a model evaluation study of the representation of lake-atmosphere interactions and resulting lake-effect snowfall in the Great Lakes region. Analysis focuses on an extensive ensemble of 74 historical simulations generated by 23 high-resolution global climate models (GCMs) from the High-Resolution Model Intercomparison Project (HighResMIP). The model assessment addresses the modeling treatment of the Great Lakes, the spatial distribution and seasonality of climatological snowfall, the seasonal cycle of lake-surface temperatures and overlake turbulent fluxes, and the lake-effect ratio between upwind and downwind precipitation. A deeper understanding of model performance and biases is achieved by partitioning results between HighResMIP GCMs that are 1) coupled to 1D lake models versus GCMs that exclude lake models, 2) between prescribed-ocean model configurations versus fully coupled configurations, and 3) between deep Lake Superior versus relatively shallow Lake Erie. While the HighResMIP GCMs represent the Great Lakes by a spectrum of approaches that include land grid cells, ocean grid cells (with lake surface temperature and ice cover boundary conditions provided by the Met Office Hadley Center Sea Ice and Sea Surface Temperature Dataset), and 1D lake models, the current investigation demonstrates that none of these rudimentary approaches adequately represent the complex nature of seasonal lake temperature and ice cover evolution and its impact on lake-atmosphere interactions and lake-effect precipitation in the Great Lakes region. Significance StatementThe purpose of this study is to evaluate the capability of high-resolution global climate models to simulate lake-atmosphere interactions and lake-effect snowfall in the Great Lakes region, given the critical influence of the lakes on regional climate and vast societal and environmental impacts of lake-effect snowfall. It is determined that the models inadequately represent lake temperatures and ice cover, often leading to insufficient annual snowfall in the lake-effect zones. More advanced, three-dimensional lake models need to be coupled to climate models to support greater credibility in regional lake and climate simulations and future climate projections.																			0022-4928	1520-0469				MAY	2022	79	5					1325	1347		10.1175/JAS-D-21-0249.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JAS-D-21-0249.1													WOS:000808541300006
J	Harrison, SP; Yu, G; Tarasov, PE				Harrison, SP; Yu, G; Tarasov, PE			Late quaternary lake-level record from northern Eurasia	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												Lake records from northern Eurasia show regionally coherent patterns of changes during the late Quaternary. Lakes peripheral to the Scandinavian ice sheet were lower than those today but lakes in the Mediterranean zone were high at the glacial maximum, reflecting the dominance of glacial anticyclonic conditions in northern Europe and a southward shift of the Westerlies. The influence of the glacial anticyclonic circulation attenuated through the late glacial period, and the Westerlies gradually shifted northward, such that drier conditions south of the ice sheet were confined to a progressively narrower zone and the Mediterranean became drier. The early Holocene shows a gradual shift to conditions wetter than present in central Asia, associated with the expanded Asian monsoon, and in the Mediterranean, in response to local, monsoon-type circulation. There is no evidence of midcontinental aridity in northern Eurasia during the mid-Holocene. In contrast, the circum-Baltic region was drier, reflecting the increased incidence of blocking anticyclones centered on Scandinavia in summer. There is a gradual transition to modern conditions after ca. 5000 yr B.P. Although these broad-scale patterns are interrupted by shorter term fluctuations, the long-term trends in lake behavior show a clear response to changes in insolation and glaciation.

Additionally, the impact of adding external carbon on nitrogen removal was investigated. Yapu River was shown to be eutrophic, with a low C/N ratio (COD/ TN = 1.5) and the main pollutant was total nitrogen (TN = 2 mg/L). CWs with substrates of combined gravel-zeolite and gravel-ceramsite showed higher ammonium nitrogen (NH_4 -N) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiencies than the CWs with gravel substrates. Trapezoidal CWs showed improved dissolved oxygen in the front when compared with the rectangular CWs, enabling complete nitrification. A longer HRT (four days) improved the removal efficiencies of organics, nitrogen, and phosphorus. CWs performed better during the warm period. Moreover, addition of 400 g cattail litter during winter led to increased influent of COD. The average removal efficiencies of NO3-N and TN were increasing up to 90.5 and 85.3%, respectively.

This study leverages the modeling capacity of an operational National Weather Service River Forecast Center to explore the potential impacts of future climate-driven hydrologic changes on factors important to planning at the Salt Lake City Department of Public Utilities (SLC). Hydrologic modeling results for the study area align with prior research in showing that temperature changes alone will lead to earlier runoff and reduced runoff volume. The sensitivity of average annual flow to temperature varies significantly between watersheds, averaging -3.8% degrees F-1 and ranging from -1.8% to -6.5% flow reduction per degree Fahrenheit of warming. The largest flow reductions occur during the high water demand months of May-September. Precipitation drives hydrologic response more strongly than temperature, with each 1% precipitation change producing an average 1.9% runoff change of the same sign. This paper explores the consequences of climate change for the reliability of SLC's water supply system using scenarios that include hydrologic changes in average conditions, severe drought scenarios, and future water demand test cases. The most significant water management impacts will be earlier and reduced runoff volume, which threaten the system's ability to maintain adequate streamflow and storage to meet late-summer water demands.

Existing BMPs consisted of banded, incorporated, and variable phosphorus (P)-rate application, conservation tillage, cover crops, and vegetative buffer strips. Potential BMPs consisted of banded P application, no-till, and a cover crop following winter wheat. Two separately delineated sub-watersheds, J1 and J2, characterized by a flat topography and distinct pumped outlets, were selected for analysis. Despite challenges in delineation, the SWAT model was successfully set up to assess the impact of BMPs in reducing P loads in these sub-watersheds. Each BMP was systematically removed, and the resulting simulated P loads were compared with the baseline scenario. Compared to cover crops or vegetative buffer strips, the implementation of conservation tillage and no-till, along with altering the mode of P application, offered superior effectiveness in reducing the P load. On average, the annual reduction in total P (Ptot) loads under existing BMPs was 9.2% in J1 and 11.3% in J2, whereas, under potential BMPs, this reduction exceeded 60% in both watersheds.

From 8600 to 7200 cal. yr BP, the local vegetation was dominated by steppe and tree cover was low. Then pine increased gradually, and the local vegetation was pine and oak mixed forest with variable ratios of the two dominant tree taxa from 7200 to 3600 cal. yr BP. From 3600 to 3000 cal. yr BP, the forest was replaced by shrubland, which was attributed to a period of intense drought. From 3000 to 600 cal. yr BP, the tree cover declined to its lowest levels, probably due to long-term further drought. After 600 cal. yr BP, steppe has become dominant again. We found that the changes of vegetation type indicated by pollen percentages did not match existing evidence for monsoon dynamics. Changes in tree pollen concentration, however, well captured the changes in the Asian monsoon, implying different sensitivity of vegetation cover and vegetation type (e.g. replacement of steppe by forest) to the monsoon development. In addition, a shrubland-dominated stage which has not been evident in previous studies was also clear in our pollen sequences. Our study implied that the responses of marginal forest to drought were variable, depending on the drought regime. The different responses of forest to climate drying in this study provide insights into the reliable prediction of forest dynamics in the semi-arid regions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Economic returns of groundwater management sustaining an ecosystem service of dust suppression by alkali meadow in Owens Valley, California	ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS												This paper addresses the economic tradeoff between pumping groundwater and maintaining a native plant community that provides an ecosystem service of dust suppression. A dynamic ecological economic simulation model was created to assess net benefits of production (i.e., economic rent) from groundwater management while requiring a producer to maintain or restore native groundwater dependent vegetation in a well -field in Owens Valley, California. Historic groundwater withdrawal during dry conditions followed by recharge during wet conditions has reduced vegetation cover, soil stability and contributed to the drying of springs and seeps. Findings indicate adaptive management that pumps less water, but high volumes in wet years and low volumes in dry years, generates greater economic rent while supplying water, sustaining alkali meadow and maintaining dust suppression. Adaptive management generates economic rent of $82.6 million (in 2011 $) compared to status quo management of $30.5 million over 50 years pumping less annual groundwater than status quo at respective levels of 73% (6830 acre -ft; baseline conditions) and 56% (4952 acre -ft; climate change scenario). Under a climate change scenario and a 2.0 m root -zone or less, it would be cost effective to cease groundwater pumping rather than incur substantial restoration costs of the native plant community.

Long-term river discharge and multidecadal climate variability inferred from varved sediments, southwest Alaska	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												Sedimentological analyses of 289 years (AD 1718-2006) of varved sediment from Shadow Bay, southwest Alaska, were used to investigate hydroclimate variability during and prior to the instrumental period. Varve thicknesses relate most strongly to total annual discharge (r(2)=0.75, n=43, p<0.0001). Maximum annual grain size depends most strongly on maximum spring daily discharge (r(2)=0.63, n=43, p<0.0001) and maximum annual daily discharge (r(2).=0.61, n=43, p<0.0001), while varve thickness is poorly correlated with maximum annual grain size (r(2)=0.004, n=287, p=0.33). Relations between varve thickness and annual climate variables (temperature, precipitation, North Pacific (NP) and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) indices) are insignificant. On multidecadal timescales, however, regime shifts in varve thickness and total annual discharge coincide with shifts in NP and PDO indices. Periods with increased varve thickness and total annual discharge were associated with warm PDO phases and a strengthened Aleutian Low.

Here, the assessment of cyanobacteria blooms considered the chlorophyll-a (chl-a), turbidity, and biomass of N2-fixing cyanobacteria. The Sentinel-3 A/B Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) data and Case-2 Regional CoastColour (C2RCC) processor were used for chl-a and turbidity detection. The ES was assessed using four methods: the Phytoplankton Intensity Index (PII), the Cyanobacterial Surface Accumulations Index (CSA), and two variants of the Cyanobacterial Bloom Indicator (CyaBI) either with in situ-measured cyanobacterial biomass or with satellite-estimated cyanobacterial biomass. The threshold values for each coastal area ES assessment are presented. During 2022, the NW Gulf of Riga reached good ES, but most of the 16 coastal areas failed to achieve good ES according to one or multiple indices. Overall, the CyaBI gives the most comprehensive assessment of cyanobacteria blooms, with the CyaBI (in situ) being the best suited for naturally turbid areas. The CyaBI (satellite) could be more useful than in situ in large open areas, where the coverage of in situ sampling is insufficient.					; Kangro, Kersti/D-8972-2015; Alikas, Krista/ABE-1431-2020; Kangro, Kersti/ABH-7713-2020	Rahn, Ian-Andreas/0000-0001-9590-0623; Kangro, Kersti/0000-0001-6143-9330; 														2076-3417				SEP	2023	13	18							10211	10.3390/app131810211	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/app131810211													WOS:001071141600001

Different responses of coexisting Chara species to foreseeable Mediterranean temperature and salinity increases	AQUATIC BOTANY												An increase in temperature of approximately 4 degrees C is expected to occur in the Mediterranean by the end of the century. Concomitant to this warming, a foreseeable rise in salinity will affect aquatic species. We addressed the effects of warming and salinity, and their interaction on three coexisting characean species (Chara aspera, C hispida and C vulgaris) from a Spanish Mediterranean interdunal pond (spring water temperature 20-23 degrees C, when charophytes re-grew; salinity 1.3-1.8 PSU). A laboratory experiment was designed with two levels of water temperature treatment (23 and 27 degrees C), plus two levels of salinity treatment (0.4 and 4.0 PSU). The variables considered were total length, number of ramifications and nodes, dry weight, growth rate and stoichiometric composition. Three clear response patterns arose: (i) C. aspera growth was favoured by the 4 degrees C rise in temperature and the 10-fold increase in salinity when considered separately, but no synergy occurred when these factors interacted; (ii) C. hispida growth did not change with the temperature, but was negatively affected by the salinity increase, and (iii) C. vulgaris growth was enhanced by the temperature, a fact that compensated for the damaging effect of increased salinity. Variations of N and P concentrations with treatments were similar in C. aspera and C vulgaris. We demonstrate how charophyte response to the interaction of increased temperature and salinity is species-specific and different under isolated stressors. Therefore, this study highlights how simultaneous drivers of global change might affect the composition of charophyte meadows in Mediterranean shallow wetlands. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

J	Russell, IA				Russell, IA			Fish abundance in the Wilderness and Swartvlei lake systems: Changes relative to environmental factors	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												Fish communities throughout the Wilderness and Swartvlei lake systems were sampled in the winters of 1991 and 1993 using gill and seine nets. Gill net catches indicated substantial increases in the abundance of large juveniles and adults of the majority of marine fish species in both systems. Seine net catches indicated increases in the abundance of juvenile Liza richardsonii, but a decline in the abundance of other fish species. The recruitment of most fish is unlikely to have been negatively affected by the recorded fluctuations in salinity or turbidity. The senescence of macrophytes, however, may have increased exposure of recruiting Monodactylus falciformis and Rhabdosargus holubi to piscivorous birds and fish. The artificial breaching of estuaries during optimum fish recruitment periods in 1991 and 1992 may have contributed to the recorded increases in the abundance of fish in 1993. A longer duration tidal phase in the Swartvlei system during 1992 and 1993, compared to the Wilderness lake system, did not result in greater abundance of fish sampled. There appears to be no justification for the artificial maintenance of permanently tidal conditions in the Swartvlei and Touw River estuaries on the grounds of benefit for the maintenance of viable fish communities.																			0254-1858					JAN	1996	31	1					1	9																WOS:A1996UX92700001

The Yellow River receives a significant amount of industrial and agricultural wastewater. Therefore, the environmental quality of NHZW directly affects the survival of migratory birds in the Baotou region. We aimed to determine the trace element distribution in tissues and risk of exposure in ruddy shelduck and to provide a scientific basis for bird protection and an environmental quality assessment for the NHZW. In January 2018, we collected water, soil, and 18 dead ruddy shelduck Tadorna ferruginea (nine males and nine females) from the NHZW. We measured concentrations of trace elements (Cd, Pb, Cu, Zn, Hg, and As) in the specimens and modeled the risk of exposure to trace elements. Trace element concentration was greatest in feathers, followed by the kidneys, liver, and muscle, in descending. There was no significant difference in trace element accumulation between sexes. Exposure doses of Hg in water; Cr, Pb, and Cu in soil; and Pb, Cu, and Hg in corn were higher than the tolerable daily intake and may adversely affect ruddy shelduck. The calculated hazard quotients (HQ) for trace elements were ranked as follows: Hg > Cr > Pb > Zn > Cu > As, where Hg and Cr were at high risk levels (HQ > 1).																			0944-1344	1614-7499				FEB	2020	27	6					6429	6437		10.1007/s11356-019-07132-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-019-07132-4		DEC 2019						31873889					WOS:000504148200013
J	Theiling, CH; Janvrin, JA; Hendrickson, J				Theiling, Charles H.; Janvrin, Jeffrey A.; Hendrickson, Jon			Upper Mississippi River restoration: implementation, monitoring, and learning since 1986	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Upper Mississippi River Restoration (UMRR) was implemented to monitor environmental status and trends and restore degraded habitat. There was little experience conducting restoration in large rivers, and engineering and ecological integration evolved through project implementation. Loss of depth in backwaters and side channels, excessive biological oxygen demand, increased currents, and low water temperatures were common symptoms of backwater eutrophication that were primary objectives for implementing UMRR. Biological outcome monitoring was initially funded for six projects using the most common methods to restore aquatic and wetland habitat. UMRR island construction occurred as four generations of learning. Current plans represent a comprehensive restoration approach including: physical process modeling (i.e. hydraulic and wind-wave modeling) of existing conditions and alternative restoration measures. Habitat Rehabilitation and Enhancement Projects, fish response monitoring validated winter habitat suitability models. Long term fish population monitoring indicates sustainable recovery, and now population interaction among restored lakes is under investigation. Isolated wetland management in Illinois River backwater lakes can achieve bottom consolidation that promotes emergent wetland habitat response that migratory waterfowl exploit in large numbers. Adult fish movement between the river and management units is restricted to flood stage or through control structures and post-project movements into the lake for overwintering were not apparent. The lack of Illinois River overwintering habitat is shown by an abundance of young fish and few older fish in status and trends monitoring. Upper Mississippi River System ecosystem restoration practitioners have implemented ecosystem restoration science and practice in a manner that exemplifies the best intent of adaptive management.																			1061-2971	1526-100X				MAR	2015	23	2					157	166		10.1111/rec.12170	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rec.12170													WOS:000353962500009

The spatiotemporal distribution characteristics of the MC-LR concentration in drinking water sources in seven river basins in China were investigated in this study. The removal rate of MC-LR in the purification process of water treatment plants and the human health risk of MC-LR in drinking water are also discussed. The results show that the detection frequency of MC-LR in source water was 55.46% and its concentration ranged from 0.06 x 10(-3) to 52 x 10(-3) mu g L-1 (mean of 12.47 x 10(-3) mu g L-1), which are both below China's drinking water quality standard for algal toxins. The MC-LR concentration in lakes and reservoirs was higher than that in rivers, and exhibited an obvious spatiotemporal variation. The mean removal rate of MC-LR varied with river basin, and was also slightly higher for the advanced water treatment process (97.46%) in comparison to that of the conventional process (96.74%). The concentration of MC-LR in 8.26% of treated water samples was higher than that of raw water, thus indicating that MC-LR may be further released during the purification process. The risk index of MC-LR in treated water samples ranged from 2.29 x 10(-3) to 8.40 x 10(-3) (mean of 4.73 x 10(-3)), which corresponded to an extremely low level of risk. However, intensive monitoring should still be carried out in some high-concentration watersheds during the summer to ensure the safety of public drinking water.																				2046-2069				FEB 12	2021	11	11					6415	6422		10.1039/d0ra08983d	http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ra08983d								35423125					WOS:000614616900065

This paper reviews some of the technical and more applied aspects of stream, river, and lake enrichment as currently practiced in British Columbia and elsewhere in the world. The first step when considering potential stream and lake enrichment is to determine the ambient nutrient concentrations, stock of biogenic biomass, and trophic status of the candidate ecosystem by conducting nutrient bioassays, synoptic surveys, low-level nutrient analyses, and qualitative assessments of the ecosystems. Phosphorus is considered limiting when concentrations in composite stream or epilinmetic lake samples during the growing season are less than 1 mug/L SRP and less than 2-3 mug/L TDR Nitrogen is considered limiting in streams when dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) concentrations during the growing season are less than 20 mug/L and in takes when spring epilinmetic concentrations are less than 30 mug/L. At minimum, a 1-2 year pre-treatment study is required to determine the nutrient status and requirements of the ecosystem. Water users and regulatory. agencies must be notified in advance of plans to add nutrients to rivers, lakes, or streams, and provincial, state, and/ or federal permitting processes and guidelines should be followed. All nutrient enrichment programs must consider seven key variables: (1) desired concentiation of nutrients, (2) type of nutrients, (3) seasonal timing of application, (4) frequency of nutrient addition, (5) location of application sites, (6) DIN:TDP (total dissolved phosphorus) ratio of nutrients to be added, and (7) application technique. Enrichment programs should attempt to mimic the anadromous salmon nutrient pump where applicable and implement a nutrient prescription that assures the production of edible phytoplankton/periphyton and avoids the occurrence of nuisance algae. In addition, sufficient funds should be secured to monitor the ecosystem responses.																			0892-2284		1-888569-44-1				2003	34						245	258																WOS:000181552500018

Two scenarios - baseline agricultural management and increased agricultural conservation - were assessed using an ensemble of five Soil and Water Assessment Tools driven by six climate models. The increased conservation scenario included raising conservation adoption rates from a baseline of existing conservation practices to feasible rates in the near future based on farmer surveys. This increased adoption of winter cover crops on 6%-10% to 60% of cultivated cropland; subsurface placement of phosphorus fertilizers on 35%-60% to 68% of cultivated cropland; and buffer strips intercepting runoff from 29%-34% to 50% of cultivated cropland. Increased conservation resulted in statistically significant (p <= 0.05) reductions in annual loads of total phosphorus (41%), dissolved reactive phosphorus (18%), and total nitrogen (14%) under the highest emission climate scenario representative concentration pathway (RCP 8.5). While nutrient loads decreased with increased conservation relative to baseline management for all watershed models, different conclusions on the true effectiveness of conservation under climate change may be drawn if only one watershed model was used.					wang, yuchen/AED-4066-2022; Muenich, Rebecca/V-7226-2018; GUO, TIAN/U-7180-2019; Aloysius, Noel/HPG-9859-2023; Confesor, Remegio/AAZ-6237-2020; Muenich, Rebecca/A-5490-2015; Scavia, Donald/P-5917-2018	Muenich, Rebecca/0000-0001-9920-9346; Confesor, Remegio/0000-0002-7306-1432; Aloysius, Noel/0000-0002-9094-427X													1093-474X	1752-1688				DEC	2022	58	6					1326	1340		10.1111/1752-1688.13023	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1752-1688.13023		JUN 2022											WOS:000811993800001

Quantification of internal phosphorus load in large, partially polymictic and mesotrophic Lake Simcoe, Ontario	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Hypoxia and cyanobacteria still occur occasionally in large, mesotrophic Lake Simcoe, and total phosphorus (TP) concentration has remained relatively constant despite external nutrient load reduction. This may indicate a potential internal P source. Internal load as redox-dependent P release from bottom sediments is hard to determine in such a relatively shallow and mostly mixed lake. This study represents the first attempt to quantify internal P loading over many years for the three main sections of Lake Simcoe. Internal load was determined (a) as in situ estimate based on TP increases between July and October and (b) as gross estimate from the product of experimentally determined P release rates and hypoxic extent of sediment surfaces in space and time. Hypoxic extent was quantified (1) as the hypoxic factor determined from dissolved oxygen profiles below the level of 3.5 mg/L, and (2) as active sediment area release factor (AA) modeled from summer euphotic TP concentration, which is especially useful in the mixed sections. Annual internal load for the whole lake was determined as a near constant 62.2 metric tonnes/yr (86 mg/m(2)/yr) for 1980-2011 using the gross estimates of the AA approach and 88 t/yr before and 53 t/yr after external load abatement and zebra mussel invasion using in situ estimates. Means of in situ and AA-based estimates for 2000-2011 are in close agreement except for polymictic Cook's Bay. These estimates are 45 to 89% of external load, which suggests that internal loading is an important source of P in Lake Simcoe. (C) 2013 International Association for Great Lakes Research.

Sirung has a crater with several hydrothermal features including a crater lake. We present a timeseries of satellite images of the lake and chemical and isotope data from the hyperacid hydrothermal system. The fluids sampled in the crater present the typical features of hyperacidic systems with high TDS, low pH and delta S-34(HSO4)-delta S-34(s0) among the highest for such lakes. The cations concentrations are predominantly controlled by the precipitation of alunite, jarosite, silica phases, native sulfur and pyrite which dominate the shallow portions of the hydrothermal system. These minerals may control shallow sealing processes thought to trigger phreatic eruptions elsewhere. Sparse Mg/Cl and SO4/CI ratios and lake parameters derived from satellite images suggest gradual increase in heat and gas flux, most likely SO2-rich, prior to the 2012 phreatic eruption. An acidic river was sampled 8 km far from the crater and is genetically linked with the fluids rising toward the active crater. This river would therefore be a relevant target for future remote monitoring purposes. Finally, several wells and springs largely exceeded the World Health Organization toxicity limits in total arsenic and fluoride. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Ft. McHenry tunnel study: Source profiles and mercury emissions from diesel and gasoline powered vehicles	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												During the fall of 1998, the US Environmental Protection Agency and the Florida Department of Environmental Protection sponsored a 7-day study at the Ft. McHenry tunnel in Baltimore, MD with the objective of obtaining PM2.5 vehicle source profiles for use in atmospheric mercury source apportionment studies. PM2.5 emission profiles from gasoline and diesel powered vehicles were developed from analysis of trace elements, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), and condensed aliphatic hydrocarbons. PM2.5 samples were collected using commercially available sampling systems and were extracted and analyzed using conventional well-established methods. Both inorganic and organic profiles were sufficiently unique to mathematically discriminate the contributions from each source type using a chemical mass balance source apportionment approach. However, only the organic source profiles provided unique PAH tracers (e.g., fluoranthene, pyrene, and chrysene) for diesel combustion that could be used to identify source contributions generated using multivariate statistical receptor modeling approaches. In addition, the study found significant emission of gaseous elemental mercury (Hg-o), divalent reactive gaseous mercury (RGM), and particulate mercury (Hg(p)) from gasoline but not from diesel powered motor vehicles. Fuel analysis supported the tunnel measurement results showing that total mercury content in all grades of gasoline (284 +/- 108 ng L-1) was substantially higher than total mercury content in diesel fuel (62 +/- 37 ng L-1) collected contemporaneously at local Baltimore retailers.

Mapping an invasive plant, Phragmites australis, in coastal wetlands using the EO-1 Hyperion hyperspectral sensor	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Mapping tools are needed to document the location and extent of Phragmites australis, a tall grass that invades coastal marshes throughout North America, displacing native plant species and degrading wetland habitat. Mapping Phragmites is particularly challenging in the freshwater Great Lakes coastal wetlands due to dynamic lake levels and vegetation diversity. We tested the applicability of Hyperion hyperspectral satellite imagery for mapping Phragmites in wetlands of the west coast of Green Bay in Wisconsin, U.S.A. A reference spectrum created using Hyperion data from several pure Phragmites stands within the image was used with a Spectral Correlation Mapper (SCM) algorithm to create a raster map with values ranging from 0 to 1, where 0 represented the greatest similarity between the reference spectrum and the image spectrum and I the least similarity. The final two-class thematic classification predicted monodominant Phragmites covering 3.4% of the study area. Most of this was concentrated in long linear features parallel to the Green Bay shoreline, particularly in areas that had been under water only six years earlier when lake levels were 66 cm higher. An error matrix using spring 2005 field validation points (n = 129) showed good overall accuracy - 81.4%. The small size and linear arrangement of Phragmites stands was less than optimal relative to the sensor resolution, and Hyperion's 30 in resolution captured few if any pure pixels. Contemporary Phragmites maps prepared with Hyperion imagery would provide wetland managers with a tool that they currently lack, which could aid attempts to stem the spread of this invasive species.

Six U-series disequilibrium dates range sequentially from 106.1 +/- 6.4 to 5.4 +/- 2.7 ka. Based on sedimentary structures and petrographic textures of salts and associated siliciclastic sediments, interpretations of paleoenvironments and net hydrologic balance suggest that relatively wet periods (saline lakes and expanded mudflats) existed in the Salar de Atacama from 75.7 to 60.7 ka and from 53.4 to 15.3 ka, with the wettest perennial lake interval from 26.7 to 16.5 ka. Short relatively wet periods also occurred in the Holocene from 11.4 to 10.2 ka and from 6.2 to 3.5 ka. These wet periods at Salar de Atacama correspond well with other late Pleistocene climate records from the central Andes that are a function of the net hydrologic budget. The Minchin-Tauca lake sequence from Salar de Uyuni, Bolivia, is synchronous with the 53.4-15.3 ka. saline lake wet period at Salar de Atacama. The Tauca phase coincided with the wettest perennial lake interval at Salar de Atacama from 26.7 to 16.5 ka. The Coipasa take phase from Uyuni was probably contemporaneous with the early Holocene wet period at Salar de Atacama from 11.4 to 10.2 ka. The early Holocene wet interval at Salar de Atacama was also synchronous with the maximum Holocene lake levels of the Chilean Altiplano lakes to the east and with grass-rich rodent middens between 11.8 and 10.5 ka in age from the Atacama basin. The take period at Salar de Atacama between 26.7 and 15.3 ka compares closely with low delta O-18 values, low anion concentrations and high accumulation rates from the Sajama glacial ice core, southwestern Bolivia between 25 and 15.5 ka. It is concluded that wet and dry phases were synchronous in the central Andean plateau of southwestern Bolivia and along the western flank of the Andes of northern Chile over the past 50 kyr. This region, which today receives its moisture from the Amazon Basin to the east, probably also did so in the past. The wet periods at Salar de Atacama are in phase with January insolation maxima at 15 degreesS at 70, 45, and 20 ka, which suggests that past changes in summer insolation influenced precipitation patterns in the central Andes. However, there are no major wet periods linked to the January insolation maximum at 93 ka and the present-day extremely dry climate in the Atacama Desert is associated with a peak in summer insolation. Therefore there must be other important influences over precipitation in the central Andes which modify the first order insolation controls. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

They are of utmost importance to climate dynamics and are critical links between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Despite the need of high attention towards conserving and managing wetland resources, mapping them is a least practiced activity. This study shows the temporal change in land use and land cover pattern of Tso Moriri Lake, the highest altitude lake in India and designated as Ramsar site in year 2002, using multi-sensor and multi-date imagery. Due to change in hydro-meteorological conditions of the region, this lake area has been reduced. Since the lake recharge is dependent on snowmelt, hence change in climatic conditions (less snowfall in winters), to a certain extent, is also responsible for the decrease in water level and water spread of the lake. The result shows that the lake area has reduced approximately 2 km(2) in the last 15 years, and also, agriculture, grasslands, and vegetation cover have increased to a significant extent. Agricultural land and grasslands have doubled while the vegetation cover has increased more than six times, showing the coupled effect of climate change and anthropogenic activities. Trend of temperature and precipitation corroborates the effects of climate change in this region.					; Gupta, Sharad Kumar/G-1124-2018; Shukla, Dericks/AAN-7131-2021; Gupta, Sharad/G-1124-2018	Shukla, Dericks/0000-0001-6546-9203; Gupta, Sharad Kumar/0000-0003-3444-1333; 													0167-6369	1573-2959				DEC	2016	188	12							700	10.1007/s10661-016-5707-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-016-5707-3								27900656					WOS:000388805000047
J	OHLE, W				OHLE, W			MINERAL IMPACT OF LAKES AS BACKGROUND FOR THEIR BIOGENIC DYNAMICS	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Favorable circumstances for limnological observations were offered by human activities at shores of some Holstein lakes [West Germany]. The lakes were enriched by clay, silt, sandy particles and hydroxides of Fe and Mn over many years in consequence of an embankment built at Schoehsee and influx of washing water from a gravel pit, respectively. During windy weather the lakes were extremely turbid, but very clear during calm weather. The 1% penetration level of green light was found at 11 and 14 m. Nutrients, small phytoplankton cells and bacteria were adsorbed on to the detritus. The sedimentation rate increased and phytoplankton production decreased. The sediments became rich in minerals comparable with alpine lakes. The epilimnic decomposition rate was much lower than in normal Holstein lakes in the neighborhood, as in Grosser Ploener See, and the highest value 15 of the short-circuit-metabolism (SCM) was measured in Pluss-See, i.e., there occurred 15 times reuse of C (and other) molecules in the euphotic region before settling down. The mineral impact of alpine lakes occurring annually under natural conditions, at least in spring, may be one of the most important factors of minor bioactivity compared with eutrophic lowland lakes.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1980	72	1-2					51	59		10.1007/BF00016233	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00016233													WOS:A1980KE34800005

Based on lithological characteristics and sedimentological proxies, we reconstructed Holocene-effective humidity changes and the lake evolution of Huahai Lake in the marginal area of the Asian monsoon in the Hexi Corridor of NW China. Our results show that alluvial and aeolian deposition before 10.4 cal ka BP indicate an arid environment, that lacustrine deposition from 10.4 to 8.8 cal ka BP indicates a transition from an arid to a humid environment, and that lacustrine deposition from 8.8 to 5.5 cal ka BP occurred during the most humid conditions, indicated by proxy records (grain size, carbonate, TOC, and C/N). After 5.5 cal ka BP, a depositional hiatus implicates an arid environment in the late Holocene. Holocene environmental changes on millennial timescales in Huahai Lake imply that climate was arid to humid in the early Holocene, most humid in the mid-Holocene and arid in the late Holocene. These moisture changes were influenced by the Asian monsoon, particularly the transportation of water vapor by the Indian monsoon. In addition, these moisture changes could have been affected by westerly winds that could have contributed to the water vapor supply to this region during the mid-Holocene. The most humid conditions that occurred in the study area during the mid-Holocene may have been caused by strong westerlies and low levels of evaporation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

J	INSKIP, PD; MAGNUSON, JJ				INSKIP, PD; MAGNUSON, JJ			CHANGES IN FISH POPULATIONS OVER AN 80-YEAR PERIOD - BIG-PINE LAKE, WISCONSIN	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												From 1897 to 1977, landowners recorded sport catches for Big Pine Lake, a 256 ha lake in northern Wisconsin that has experienced light fishing pressure. The species composition of the catch remained fairly stable for 40 yr, from 1897 through 1940, with muskellunge Esox masquinongy, walleye Stizostedion vitreum vitreum and black bass (Micropterus spp.) all accounting for substantial fractions of the total. Northern pike E. lucius were first recorded in 1946, apparently having entered after an outlet dam washed out in 1944. Subsequent increases in the proportion of northern pike coincided with declining percentages of muskellunge. By the 1950s, the relative abundance of walleye declined, ultimately almost to zero, while the percentage of bass more than doubled. This change began during the warmest decade on record. By 1977, the walleye population had rebounded, bass had declined to pre-1940 levels, northern pike were abundant and muskellunge were relatively scarce. Long-term changes in summer temperatures and colonization by northern pike appear to have been important factors causing changes in species composition. Effects of human exploitation have been slight. Although the species composition changed dramatically over the 80 yr, the only sustained change has been the substitution of northern pike muskellunge.																			0002-8487	1548-8659					1983	112	3					378	389		10.1577/1548-8659(1983)112<378:CIFPOA>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1983)112<378:CIFPOA>2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1983QY43000003

The ESC is a similar to 3 km wide and 50-150 m deep ice cauldron created and maintained by subglacial geothermal activity of similar to 1GW. Beneath the cauldron and 200-400 m thick ice, water accumulates in a subglacial lake and is released semi-regularly in jokulhlaups. The RES record consists of annual surveys conducted at the beginning of every summer during the period 2014-2020. Comparison of the RES surveys reveals variable lake area (0.5-4.1 km(2)) and enables traced reflections from the lake roof to be distinguished from bedrock reflections. This allows construction of a digital elevation model (DEM) of the bedrock in the area, further constrained by two borehole measurements at the cauldron centre. It also allows creation of lake thickness maps and an estimate of lake volume at the time of each survey, which we compare with lowering patterns and released water volumes obtained from pre- and post-jokulhlaup surface DEMs. The estimated lake volume was 250 GL (gigalitres = 10(6) m(3)) in June 2015, but 320 +/- 20 GL drained from the ESC in October 2015. In June 2018, RES profiles revealed a lake volume of 185 GL, while 220 +/- 30 GL were released in a jokulhlaup in August 2018. Considering the water accumulation over the periods between RES surveys and jokulhlaups, this indicates 10 %-20% uncertainty in the RES-derived volumes at times when significant jokulhlaups may be expected.

Overall, level 22A is related to a more hydrologically closed system, with higher salinity and alkalinity than level 22B. Both levels show fresher water was entering the system from the DS area during deposition. Textural analysis of the studied samples shows great microporosity and abundant edge-to-edge and edge-to-face contacts between crystals. These results have major repercussions for the interpretation of the archaeological assemblages in the FLK Zinj-DS-PTK-AMK palaeolandscape. First, this implies that two distinct archaeological levels formed at different times with different environmental conditions in most of these localities. Second, textural analyses provide evidence that no important sedimentary compaction took place after the deposition of this layer. This affects interpretations of palaeolandscape geomorphology. Third, it shows that the sedimentary processes during all the clay sequence occurred in very low-energy conditions. This reinforces that no significant physical forces disturbed the original configurations of materials contained within these assemblages and reinforces their autochthony. Behavioural interpretations can, thus, be more solidly built upon the conception that those sites preserve most of their original in situ properties.

This study investigated the processes driving spatiotemporal patterns of under-ice CO2 in large Lake Onego. In March 2015 and 2016, under-ice CO2, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) distributions were measured along a river to an open-lake transect. CO2 decreased from 120/129 mu mol L-1 in the river to 51/98 mu mol L-1 in the bay, and 34/36 mu mol L-1 in the open lake, while DOC decreased from 1.18/1.55 mmol L-1 in the river to 0.67/1.04mmol L-1 in the bay in 2015 and 2016, respectively. These decreases in concentrations with increasing distance from the river mouth indicate that river discharge modulates spatial patterns of under-ice CO2. The variability between the 2 years was mainly driven by river discharge and ice transparency affecting the extent of under-ice convection. Higher discharge during winter 2016 resulted in higher CO2 concentrations in the bay. By contrast, intensive under-ice convection led to lower, more homogeneously distributed CO2 in 2015. In conclusion, the river-to-bay transition zone is characterized by strong CO2 variability and is therefore an important zone to consider when assessing the CO2 budget of large lakes.					; Schubert, Carsten/GQQ-1673-2022	Bouffard, Damien/0000-0002-2005-9718; Hofmann, Hilmar/0000-0001-6140-5886; Schubert, Carsten J./0000-0003-1668-5967; Tofield Pasche, Natacha/0000-0002-9578-9301; 													2044-2041	2044-205X					2019	9	2			SI		162	176		10.1080/20442041.2019.1568073	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/20442041.2019.1568073													WOS:000482317700004

Active faults locally offset the high shoreline, but cannot explain the regional upwarping attributed to isostatic rebound since 13 ka, Preliminary models of the rebound yield an upper mantle viscosity of 10(18) Pa s that implies a Maxwell relaxation time of about 300 yr, The rapid Earth response, coupled with the rapid fall in lake level at the end of Pleistocene time, may have acted to divert some of the major rivers flowing into the basin from one terminal subbasin to another, The regional deformation caused by the rebound may also have acted to control the present location of Honey Lake. These shoreline data, therefore, support the potential for a link between climate change, deep Earth processes, and surficial processes.

However, competition mechanisms between the different bloom-forming cyanobacteria species remain to be elucidated. In this paper, for the first time, the allelopathic effect of the cyanobacterium Chrysosporum ovalisporum on the cyanobacterium Microcystis panniformis is reported. The results of our study conducted in a Chinese shallow coastal water body demonstrated that the biomass of M. panniformis was relatively low during the C. ovalisporum blooming period. Co-cultivation of a C. ovalisporum strain with a M. panniformis strain showed strong inhibition of the growth of M. panniformis but stimulation of C. ovalisporum. Thus, filtrate of C. ovalisporum culture had a strong inhibitory effect on the performance of M. panniformis by decreasing the maximum optical quantum yield (F-v/F-m), the electron transport rate (ETR) of PS II and the onset of light saturation (I-k) and by increasing the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity of M. panniformis. Our results suggest that the inter-specific allelopathic effect plays an important role in the competition between different cyanobacteria species. We foresee the importance of C. ovalisporum to intensify in a future warmer world, not least in small-to medium-sized, warm and high conductivity coastal water bodies.

We analyzed changes in the flow of the Hirmand River (90 percent of the total inflow to the lakes) at the international border, and precipitation over this river's sub-basin during 1960-2016 by calculating standardized indices for precipitation (SPI) and discharge (SDI). We applied Normalized Difference Spectral Indices using satellite images from 1987 to 2021 to observe monthly areal change of the lakes. The results show that the major cause of desiccation is upstream water regulation which severely reduced the Hirmand River inflow delivery to the lakes. Constructed reservoirs near the lakes by Iran in 2008, compounded the effect of Afghanistan water regulation to aggravate the situation. There is a discernible shift in the relation between the Hirmand River flow at the border and upstream precipitation before and after 2004. In 1960-2003, high Hirmand River inflows were expected due to high precipitation, while the flow declined after 2004 despite large amounts of upstream precipitation. Although a long period of drought from 1998 to 2004 decreased the lakes' area, the lake system is primar-ily falling victim to anthropogenic flow reduction recently. Increased regulation of flows and use of water for irrigation in Afghanistan and Iran underscores the necessity of bilateral dialogues between the two countries to consider environmental flow for the lakes. The lakes' shrinkage places socio-economic stress on an already-vulnerable region with public health implications as the exposed lake beds turn into major sources of dust storms.(c) 2022 The Authors.

Ecoacoustic monitoring of lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) spawning and its relation to anthropogenic noise	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY												Lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) are endangered in the Laurentian Great Lakes with increasing binational efforts to establish spawning grounds to aid restoration. While SCUBA surveys can document spawning activity, these are labour-intensive and may disrupt spawning. We used passive acoustic monitoring to quantify spawning sounds of lake sturgeon as a first step to developing remote sensing of sturgeon spawning grounds. Acipenser sp. are known to make a variety of sounds including, "thunders" (aka drums), which have been documented in A. fulvescens during spawning. We quantified drums from a known spawning bed. We recorded 5 different potential sturgeon sounds but only quantified drums as a marker for spawning activity. Drums were low frequency with average frequency peaks at 40 and 92 Hz and a rapid drop-off thereafter. There was no relationship between calling activity and water temperature but calling activity increased as the summer progressed. Call production was most active from 0600 to 1500 h with little calling activity during nighttime recordings. The presence of low frequency boat sounds did correlate with a reduction in maximum calling rate so it is possible that commercial shipping may disrupt sturgeon communication, but more research is necessary to separate correlational from causative effects. These recordings represent a promising approach to map sturgeon spawning activity and show the potential effect of human activity on communication in this threatened species.

J	Carrillo, Y; Guarín, A; Guillot, G				Carrillo, Yolima; Guarin, Alejandro; Guillot, Gabriel			Biomass distribution, growth and decay of Egeria densa in a tropical high-mountain reservoir (NEUSA, Colombia)	AQUATIC BOTANY												in tropical settings, freshwater macrophytes can reach abundant biomasses. The combination of high temperatures, high irradiances and a continuous growing season are commonly held responsible for such prolific growth. Most research in tropical systems has been done in low altitudes. High-altitude systems, though, are common settings for macrophytes in the tropics, and constitute a unique environment as temperatures can reach values comparable with sub-tropical winter ranges on a daily basis. We sought to study the biomass dynamics, and distribution of Egeria densa P., a dominant submerged weed in Neusa Reservoir (Colombian Andes, 2970 m.a.s.l.). The specific objectives were: (1) to assess the spatial distribution of standing biomass of E. densa in relation to some characteristics of the littoral zone, (2) to study its growth and decay rates as a function of water depth and (3) to compare standing biomass, growth and decay rates in Neusa with those found for other laboratory and natural systems. E. densa occupied a continuous fringe along the littoral and was present on slopes up to 40%. It was found down to 7 m in depth. Average biomass was 522 g m(-2), was highest at intermediate depths and increased with slope and proximity to water effluents. Maximum depth of colonization and maximum biomass were underestimated when using available models based on Secchi depth. Maximum biomass was the highest macrophyte biomass reported in the literature while mean biomass was among the highest. Relative growth rate and elongation rates were negatively affected by depth. RGR as well as decomposition rate were low in comparison with estimates for E. densa in other systems. When analyzing available data from other studies and the present one, mean air temperature was better than latitude at predicting mean biomass. We propose that the high values of standing biomass in Neusa result from the combination of low decay rates and low but continuous growth throughout the year, conditions only possible in this kind of environment. This study provides evidence of the distinctiveness of high-altitude tropical macrophyte stands in terms of distribution, biomass dynamics and their regulating factors. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Geomorphological characteristics of the Um-Rimam depression in northern Kuwait	KUWAIT JOURNAL OF SCIENCE												Um-Rimam depression is one of the largest depressions in Kuwait. It is about 16.5 km(2) and located in northern Kuwait. It consists of a northern and southern playa whose floors cover 0.39 and 0.72 km(2) at 50 m and 60 m above sea level, respectively. The two playas are separated by a narrow zone (250 m in width) called the neck area. The depression is developed on alluvial sediments classified under Kuwait Group (Oligo-Pleistocene). The main geomorphological features of the study area are wadis, playas and yardangs. 73 wadis (11 major and 62 minor wadis) were observed in the field with variable orientations. The depression is a mere erogional feature, because no indications of a tectonic origin have been found in the study area. The depression has a variety of surface sediments such as pebbly sheets, active sand sheets, wadi fill deposits, alluvial fans, falling dunes, and nabkha deposits around shrub (Haloxylon salicornicum and Lycium shawii). The surface sediments in the Um-Rimam depression are sandy, poorly sorted, positively skewed and very platykurtic. The amount of aeolian deposits (sand and dust) is low in the study area compared to the average deposited aeolian particles in surrounding areas within Kuwait, but the annual amount of sand trapped in the northern playa (31 kg.yr(-1)) is higher than the southern playa. The proposed artificial lakes in the depression might be good for improving the vegetation cover and wildlife, but an environmental impact assessment study should be prepared.

Walleye Sander vitreus have a long propagation and stocking history, and sex ratios of hatchery-reared Walleye have been variable, typically skewed towards males, and potentially influenced by temperature. In contrast to previous fry and small fingerling Walleye stocking in Wisconsin water bodies, the Wisconsin Walleye Initiative of 2013 focused on the production of extended growth Walleye fingerlings (EGW) stocked out in fall under the assumption of greater survivorship and in response to observed declines in Walleye natural recruitment. Observed sex ratios of adult Walleye in a stocked northern Wisconsin lake chain were suggestive of EGW sex ratios skewed towards females. This lake chain has been under rehabilitation and an aggressive EGW stocking regime due to prolonged Walleye natural recruitment failures. To test whether imbalances in EGW were occurring, we collected 30 EGW from one Wisconsin hatchery in 2019 and about 50 EGW from each of three Wisconsin hatcheries in 2020 to histologically determine sex ratios. In 2019, EGW were about 97% female. In 2020, the percentage of females in hatchery samples ranged from 60% to 100%. Nonfemales in 2019 and 2020 were all undifferentiated. Our results suggest that EGW raised in Wisconsin under similar incubation and rearing protocols may be skewed towards females. If sex ratios of EGW are skewed towards females, the use of EGW may hinder efforts to rehabilitate natural recruitment. A deductive experimental and observational framework will be used to test for mechanism(s) influencing the high percentage of females in the hatchery product to inform protocols to better balance sex ratios.

Nine PFS species were determined: perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS), perfluorooctane sulfonamide (FOSA), perfluoroheptanoate (PFHpA), perfluorooctanoate (PFOA), perfluorononanoate (PFNA), perfluorodecanoate (PFDA), perfluoroundecanoate (PFUA), perfluorododecanoate (PFDDA), and perfluorotridecanoate (PFTDA). PFSs were detected in all rivers, revealing nationwide contamination of rivers. In particular, 11 out of 20 river samples exceeded New Jersey guidance for PFOA in drinking water (40 ng/L). PFOS, PFHpA, PFOA, and PFNA were major species in Japan. Concentrations of PFOS, PFHpA, and PFNA in rivers were strongly correlated with population density, suggesting that the chemicals were derived from urban activities. PFOA showed a significant but weak correlation. We used crotamiton, a marker of sewage effluent, for further source analysis. Concentrations of PFOS, PFHpA,and PFNA were strongly correlated with those of crotamiton, and plots of secondary effluents fell near the regression lines of rivers, indicating that the PFOS, PFHpA, and PFNA in rivers were derived from sewage effluent. On the other hand, PFOA was found at remarkably high levels (54-192 ng/L) in seven river samples containing low levels of crotamiton, suggesting that it was derived from nonsewage point sources, as well as sewage effluent. The total fluxes of sewage-derived PFOS, PFHpA, PFOA, and PFNA from Japan were estimated to be 3.6, 2.6, 5.6, and 2.6 t/year, respectively. This is the first report to identify PFOA in several rivers, derived from nonsewage point sources, by using a marker of sewage effluent.

We seatched for the presence of this rare species along the shores of 53 privately-owned lakes and portions of Lago Argentin across 12,000 km(2) of steppe habitat in Santa Cruz Province, southern Argentina and compared characteristics of occupied and unoccupied lakes. Aeolian lunette size was a significant predictor of occupancy. Most lakes had only a single pair of breeding birds, although one had 14 pairs. No lake feature successfully predicted number of breeding pairs per lake. Territories were on cobbled beaches on the side of the lake with Aeolian lunettes, and at sites significantly closer to small streams and further from vegetation than random sites. Nest sites within territories had significantly less clay than unused sites. Clutch size was small (1-2) while hatching success was moderate (70%). Future studies of this species should focus on adult and juvenile survival, and the development of a demographic model that assesses the long-term stability of the population.

Our approach differs from published studies in other regions (on training sets and transfer functions) because (1) although only one lake is examined, we use the internal lake gradients rather than gradients among lakes and (2) the majority of the dominant diatom taxa are endemic. Canonical correspondence analysis on 93 surface sediment diatom assemblages reveals that major taxa show distinct relationships with measured environmental variables. Five significant variables were identified: snow thickness on ice (which accumulates on the frozen lake surface between January and April/May), water depth, suspended matter, annual solar radiation, and mean July temperature of surface waters. The strongest relationship is with snow thickness, which influences light levels in the water below the ice. A diatom-based inference model has been developed to predict snow thickness on the ice using weighted averaging (WA) and WA with tolerance down-weighting (WA,,,) models. Results suggest that Lake Baikal diatom assemblages in surface sediments can be used to develop a robust model for estimating snow thickness across frozen Lake Baikal (r(jack)(2) = 0.607, RMSEP = 0.138 log cm). This model has potential applications for recent paleoclimate studies in this region of continental Eurasia.

Maps of the lake-level data from across eastern North America, show a reorganization of climate patterns that the pollen data independently match. Raised lake-levels and expanded populations of moist-tolerant southern pines (Pinus) document that summer monsoons intensified in the southeastern United States between 9000 and 8000 cal yr BP. Simultaneously, low lake-levels and an eastward expansion of the prairie illustrate an increase in mid-continental aridity. After the Hudson Bay ice dome collapsed around 8200 cal yr BP, lake-levels rose in New England, as populations of mesic plant taxa, such as beech (Fagus) and hemlock (Tsuga), replaced those of dry-tolerant northern pines (Pinus). Available moisture increased there after a related century-scale period of colder-than-previous conditions around 8200 cal yr BP, which is also recorded in the pollen data. The comparison between pollen and lake-level data confirms that vegetations dynamics reflect climatic patterns on the millennial-scale. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

In winter, marimo are exposed to low water temperatures at 1-4 degrees C but protected from strong sunlight by ice coverage, which may disappear due to global warming. In this study, photoinhibition in marimo was examined at 2 degrees C using chlorophyll fluorescence and 830 nm absorption. Filamentous cells of A. linnaei dissected from marimo were exposed to strong light at 2 degrees C. Photosystem II (PSII) was markedly photoinhibited, while photosystem I was unaffected. When the cells with PSII damaged by the 4 h treatment were subsequently illuminated with moderate repair light at 2 degrees C, the maximal efficiency of PSII was recovered to the level before photoinhibition. However, after the longer photoinhibitory treatments, PSII efficiency did not recover by the repair light. When the cells were exposed to simulated diurnal light for 12 h per day, which was more ecological, the cells died within a few days. Our results showed new findings of the PSII repair at 2 degrees C and serious damage at the cellular level from prolonged high-light treatments. Further, we provided a clue to what may happen to marimo in Lake Akan in the near future.

A numerical study of the temperature dynamics at McNary Dam	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												High summer water temperatures have caused increased juvenile fish stress in fish passage facilities at McNary Dam. The need to better understand the main mechanisms that generate high temperatures and result in subsequent harmful stress to downstream migrating fish motivates this study. Most numerical studies of temperature dynamics in reservoirs are based on one- or two-dimensional models. McNary Dam forebay is characterized by complex three-dimensional flow patterns and unsteady heat exchange between the atmosphere and water. An unsteady three-dimensional non-hydrostatic model is used in this paper to predict the hydrodynamics and thermal dynamics in the forebay and turbine intakes of McNary Dam. This model is based on the Reynolds Average Navier-Stokes equations, using a Boussinesq approach, with a standard k-epsilon model to solve the flow field. The thermal model takes into account the short and long wave radiation and heat convection at the free surface, which is function of air temperature and wind velocity. The predicted temperature is compared against a 24 h field data set for a warm day in 2004. Simulated and measured temperature profiles in the forebay and within the gatewells show reasonable agreement. An additional simulation studies the inclusion of a thermal curtain upstream of the turbine intakes. Numerical results indicate that the thermal curtain reduces gatewell temperatures potentially increasing survival for migratory salmonids at the dam. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Lakes Nipigon and Superior were also studied for 2 yr. These lakes varied in surface area from 29 to 8.223 x 10(6) ha, they all stratified fully during the summer and had water renewal times >5 yr. All lakes were severely P deficient; however, the large lakes (>2000 ha) were consistently less P deficient than small lakes. A growth-rate indicator (photosynthesis normalized to particulate C) agreed with nutrient status indicators, in that small lakes had lower rates than large lakes. Total P was a good predictor of chlorophyll, but factors related to lake size (temperature and mixed depth) were equally good or better predictors of nutrient status. Decreasing mean water column light intensity could not explain the lower P deficiency of large lakes. The deeper, more energetic mixed layers in large lakes apparently cause P to be recycled more efficiently. Extrapolation of observations or experimental results from small to large lakes requires recognition that phytoplankton in large lakes are less nutrient deficient and may have higher growth rates.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				DEC	1994	51	12					2769	2783		10.1139/f94-277	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f94-277													WOS:A1994RD71800015

The spherules are mostly c. 1 mm in diameter and have cyanophyte and chlorophyte inclusions. Some spherules enclose parallel bundles of complete cyanophyte fibres and probably grew within a living cyanophyte mat. The botryoidal accretions were commonly seeded upon wood and other exposed organic remains such as bone, and they completely enclose twigs and branches where these were held above the sediment surface. Botryoidal accretions commonly contain the remains of a benthos of cyanophytes, chlorophytes and ostracods. Both types of calcite have carbon and oxygen stable isotope values similar to those of known fresh-water precipitates. Their stable isotope and trace element geochemistries are consistent with precipitation on the floor of a tropical fresh-water lake within a volcanic setting, but removed from the influence of any hot-spring activity. Spherules and botroids are mineralogically closely similar and, whilst precipitation may have been biogenically mediated, they are regarded as passive lake floor cements. The carbonate laminae are dominated by rhombohedral calcite. Many of these laminae may have originated as calcite suspensoids which settled to the lake floor during relatively brief precipitation events, blanketing the normally richly organic substrate, smothering the cyanophyte mats, and leading to the preservation of individual organic laminae. Crystals later became enlarged and intergrown within the sediment, but this occurred early and prior to significant compaction, because detail of fragile and degradable organic constituents is commonly preserved. The likely source of the carbonate is through leaching of the local basic volcanic terrain. The precipitation of two types of calcite implies regular fluctuations in the chemistry of the lake waters, or in the factors controlling precipitation, which may have been a biogenic and/or seasonal effect.					; Fallick, Anthony/MGB-3739-2025	Fallick, Anthony/0000-0002-7649-6167; 													0263-5933						1994	84		3-4				213	221																WOS:A1994MY73300007

Our understanding of the forms and frequency of occurrence of such interactions is limited; assessments using field data have been constrained as a result of varying data forms and quality. To address this issue, we demonstrate a statistical approach capable of assessing multiple stressor interactions using contrasting data forms in 3 European catchments (Loch Leven Catchment, UK: assessment of phytoplankton response in a single lake with time series data; Pinios Catchment, Greece: macroinvertebrate response across multiple rivers using spatial data; and Lepsamanjoki Catchment, Finland: phytoplankton response across multiple rivers using spatiotemporal data). Statistical models were developed to predict the relative and interactive effects of climate change and nutrient enrichment sensitive indicators (stressors) on indicators of ecological quality (ecological responses) within the framework of linear mixed effects models. In all catchments, indicators of nutrient enrichment were identified as the primary stressor, with climate change-sensitive indicators causing secondary effects (Loch Leven: additive, total phosphorus [TP] x precipitation; Pinios: additive, nitrate x dissolved oxygen; Lepsamanjoki: synergistic, TP x summer water temperature), the intensity of which varied between catchments and along the nutrient stressor gradient. Simple stressor change scenarios were constructed for each catchment and used in combination with mechanistic models to explore potential management responses. This approach can be used to explore the need for multiple stressor management in freshwaters, helping practitioners navigate a complex world of environmental change.					; Birk, Sebastian/B-3125-2013; Carvalho, Laurence/D-3276-2009; Chapman, Daniel/C-2900-2008; Stefanidis, Konstantinos/H-7262-2019; Spears, Bryan/I-3688-2012; Stefanidis, Kostas/H-7262-2019	Rankinen, Katri/0000-0001-8744-1420; Birk, Sebastian/0000-0002-2597-8692; Carvalho, Laurence/0000-0002-9768-9902; Chapman, Daniel/0000-0003-1836-4112; Stefanidis, Konstantinos/0000-0002-9121-3188; Vuorio, Kristiina/0000-0001-7974-0092; Ives, Stephen/0000-0003-1702-2030; 													2044-2041	2044-205X				JAN 2	2022	12	1			SI		94	106		10.1080/20442041.2020.1827891	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/20442041.2020.1827891		MAR 2021											WOS:000632273800001

The exposed delta areas derived from the satellite images using an unsupervised classification method were applied to evaluate the long-term land growth and seasonal area variations in the WLD and AD, as well as their main influencing factors. The results show that the land growth rate of the WLD decreased relative to the mean sea level from 1.67 km(2)/year to 0.35 km(2)/year from 1983-1999 to 1999-2017, and the growth rate of the AD decreased from 1.51 km(2)/year to 0.80 km(2)/year from 1973-1999 to 1999-2017. The land building of the two subdeltas during the 1980s to 1999 was more efficient than that from 1999 to 2017. The significant decreases in the land growth rate and land building efficiency are attributed both to the increased impact from relative sea level rise and to the decrease in river sediment discharge, and the extension of the distributary channels, as well. The satellite-derived exposed areas of the WLD and AD show unique seasonal loops affected by the growth of vegetation during the warmer weather from April to June and the decay of vegetation mainly due to the cold fronts in December, which is different from the monotonic changes in the areas of other deltas, mainly driven by the rise and fall of water levels. A new method based on the correction between the exposed areas and water levels from December to April was used to estimate the vertical growth rates of the WLD and AD. After deducting the relative sea level rise rate, the net sediment deposition rates of the WLD and AD were estimated to be 20.8 and 24.2 mm/year, respectively. Approximately 72% and 62% of the sediments deposited in the WLD and AD were used to offset the effects of relative sea level rise when building deltaic lands from 1999 to 2017. This study not only improves our understanding of the growth of newborn subdeltas but also aids in assessing whether river course shifts and sediment diversions can restore deltas or deltaic wetlands that are at risk of drowning.

The great interest generated by the discovery of these new virus infections in 1988 has to some extent abated but much high quality research has continued in this field as the workshop showed. There is some serological evidence that the viruses have continued to circulate in most areas since the initial epizootics. As to their origin, it appears that the most likely source of the European seal morbillivirus (PDV-1) is the North Atlantic and Arctic seal populations. As to the origin of the Mediterranean dolphin morbillivirus and the morbilliviruses isolated from porpoises, there is serological evidence that the viruses are widespread in many cetacean species in the Atlantic and 93% of long-finned pilot whales (Globicephala melas) which mass stranded between 1982 and 1993 were morbillivirus seropositive. The epizootic in freshwater seals in Lake Baikal was unrelated to events in the European marine mammal populations. The virus which infected these animals (PDV-2) is indistinguishable from canine distemper held strains. Serological and molecular biological studies provided evidence for the presence of the virus in the seals, at least as late as the Summer of 1992 when the animals were last sampled.					; Hall, Ailsa/E-1596-2011; Domingo, Mariano/A-1015-2009	Hall, Ailsa/0000-0002-7562-1771; Domingo, Mariano/0000-0002-9623-4826													0378-1135					MAY	1995	44	2-4					261	265		10.1016/0378-1135(95)00019-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0378-1135(95)00019-7								8588320					WOS:A1995RB43400017
J	HOROWITZ, A; ATLAS, RM				HOROWITZ, A; ATLAS, RM			RESPONSE OF MICROORGANISMS TO AN ACCIDENTAL GASOLINE SPILLAGE IN AN ARCTIC FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEM	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												The response of microorganisms to an accidental spillage of 55,000 gal of leaded gasoline into an Arctic freshwater lake was studied. Shifts in microbial populations were detected after the spillage, reflecting the migration pattern of the gasoline, enrichment for hydrocarbon utilizers and selection for leaded-gasoline-tolerant microorganisms. Ratios of gasoline-tolerant/utilizing heterotrophs to total heterotrophs were a sensitive indicator of the degree of hydrocarbon contamination. Respiration rates were elevated in the highly contaminated area, but did not reflect differences between moderately and lightly contaminated areas. Hydrocarbon biodegradation potential experiments showed that indigenous microorganisms could extensively convert hydrocarbons to CO2. In situ measurement of gasoline degradation showed that, if untreated, sediment samples retained significant amounts of gasoline hydrocarbons including volatile components at the time the lake froze for the winter. Nutrient addition and bacterial inoculation resulted in enhanced biodegradative losses, significantly reducing the amount of residual hydrocarbons. Enhanced biodegradation resulted in the appearance of compounds not detected in the gasoline. Since the contaminated lake serves as a drinking water supply, treatment to enhance microbial removal of much of the remaining gasoline still may be advisable.																			0099-2240	1098-5336					1977	33	6					1252	1258		10.1128/AEM.33.6.1252-1258.1977	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.33.6.1252-1258.1977								879781					WOS:A1977DL05600004

Groundwater level trend analysis using the statistical auto-regressive HARTT method	HYDROLOGICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												In this study, the Hydrograph Analysis: Rainfall and Time-Trends (HARTT) model was used to determine the contribution of climatic and non-climatic stresses on groundwater levels in the Lake Haramaya well-field, Ethiopia. Monthly precipitation and monitored water-level data were used as explanatory variables of the method. Variability in rainfall explained 81.3% of groundwater levels using 2-month average time-delay. The coefficient of the impact of rainfall on groundwater level (K-1) was found to be 0.00562 +/- 0.0007 mm. This K-1 value indicates that a 1 mm increase in rainfall from the annual average rainfall raises the groundwater-level by 0.00562 +/- 0.0007 mm, while 1 mm decrease in rainfall causes a 0.00562 +/- 0.0007 mm drop in groundwater-level in the area. However, the average falling trend of the groundwater level (K-2) was 1.51 +/- 0.133 m/year, even with rainfall causing water-levels to rise between 1.01 to 3.29 m/year. With decreased rainfall, rainfall accounted for about 19.5% of the total-draw-down, while 80.5% was due to cumulative effects of non-climatic variables. This shows that rainfall inputs are negated by cumulative non-climatic stresses leading to the long-term net decline in groundwater level. Projected water-level results show that groundwater levels will be below pumping positions in <24 years which may have dire consequences for local landowners.					; Reading, Michael/KVB-5477-2024; Tafesse, Nata/AAZ-5860-2021; Agumassie, Tena/AAL-3707-2021; Shishaye, Haile/AAI-5592-2020	Reading, Michael/0000-0002-2953-1396; Shishaye, Haile/0000-0001-6035-7966; Alamirew, Tena/0000-0001-7491-4401													1882-3416						2020	14	1					17	22		10.3178/hrl.14.17	http://dx.doi.org/10.3178/hrl.14.17													WOS:000514180800003
J	KJENSMO, J				KJENSMO, J			INTERNAL ENERGY, THE WORK OF THE WIND, AND THE THERMAL-STABILITY IN LAKE TYRIFJORD, SOUTHEASTERN NORWAY	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Lake Tyrifjord consists of Holsfjord and Steinsfjord, two lakes of highly contrasting morphology, was used as the basis for a comparison of internal energy, the work of the wind, and thermal stability in two lakes under identical large-scale climatic conditions. Because of simultaneous temperature measurements available for the summer of 1973 from the two lakes, the present paper is based on these observations. The deep Holsfjord (Z(max) = 295 m) accumulates internal energy of an order representative for its geographical situation. Its annual heat budget in 1973 was 129735 j cm-2. Steinsfiord (Z(max) = 22 m) accumulated 60 per cent of the latter. At the stratifications representing maximum stability in 1973, the stability S in Holsfjord exceeded the corresponding value in Steinsfjord by a factor of 37, whereas the work of the wind B in Holsfjord was only 1.45 times the Steinsfjord B value. The much greater center of volume moment under homoiothermal conditions typical of Holsfjord was responsible for the great difference between energy conditions in the two lakes, as clearly demonstrated by the B + S values. The ratio (B + S)/B shows that the water masses of Steinsfjord would maintain homoiothermal conditions throughout the heating season with an increase in B (i.e. an increase in external energy supply) of ca 40 per cent. The additional energy supply needed to maintain homoiothermal conditions in Holsfjord was of the order of 1200 per cent of B for Holsfjord. Accordingly, the metalimnetic thermal discontinuity represents a far more effective mixing barrier in Holsfjord than in Steinsfjord. Calculations of the (B + S)/B ratios for other lakes show that this ratio is useful for a judgment of the degree of stagnancy of a lake's hypolimnetic water masses.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				JUN 24	1994	286	1					53	59		10.1007/BF00007280	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00007280													WOS:A1994NZ87800005

This is of particular concern in densely populated urban areas where usages and impacts of human populations on water ecosystems are strongly interconnected. Microbial biodiversity is commonly used as a bioindicator of environmental quality and ecosystem functioning, but there are few studies at the regional scale that integrate the drivers of dominance in phytoplankton communities and their consequences on the structure and functioning of these communities. Here, we studied the causes and consequences of phytoplankton dominance in 50 environmentally contrasted waterbodies, sampled over four summer campaigns in the highly-populated Ile-de-France region (IDF). Phytoplankton dominance was observed in 32-52% of the communities and most cases were attributed to Chlorophyta (35.5-40.6% of cases) and Cyanobacteria (30.3-36.5%). The best predictors of dominance were identified using multinomial logistic regression and included waterbody features (surface, depth and connection to the hydrological network) and water column characteristics (total N, TN:TP ratio, water temperature and stratification). The consequences of dominance were dependent on the identity of the dominant organisms and included modifications of biological attributes (richness, cohesion) and functioning (biomass, RUE) of phytoplankton communities. We constructed co-occurrence networks using high resolution phytoplankton biomass and demonstrated that networks under dominance by Chlorophyta and Cyanobacteria exhibited significantly different structure compared with networks without dominance. Furthermore, dominance by Cyanobacteria was associated with more profound network modifications (e.g. cohesion, size, density, efficiency and proportion of negative links), suggesting a stronger disruption of the structure and functioning of phytoplankton communities in the conditions in which this group dominates. Finally, we provide a synthesis on the relationships between environmental drivers, dominance status, community attributes and network structure. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Darling, WG				Darling, WG			Hydrothermal hydrocarbon gases: 2, application in the East African Rift System	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												Hydrocarbon gases are ubiquitous in the hydrothermal systems of the East African Rift System (EARS), though often found at very low concentrations in the 'volcanic' eastern branch as compared to the 'sedimentary' western branch. Study of the chemical and isotopic compositions of these hydrocarbons from sites in Kenya, Ethiopia, Djibouti and Uganda reveals considerable homogeneity over hundreds of km of the various rift units. Consideration of C and He isotopic evidence points to a predominantly crustal thermogenic origin for the hydrocarbons, there being no evidence of mantle inputs in either the MORE or 'hotspot' sectors of the EARS. Temperature information from geothermal wells has been utilised to investigate the relationship between reservoir temperatures and ratios of CH4 to C2H6. The general C-1/C-2 geothermometric relationship proposed in Part 1 of this study holds reasonably well, and is shown to give results equal to or better than the 'inorganic' gas geothermometers presently in use, both in the wellfields and undeveloped high-enthalpy geothermal areas. Results from low-enthalpy hot spring systems are less well correlated with apparent deep temperatures, but consistent with data from similar systems elsewhere in the world. (C) 1998 NERC.

Late Quaternary TEX86 paleotemperatures from the world's largest desert lake, Lake Turkana, Kenya	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY					6th International Limnogeology Congress (ILIC) of the International-Association-of-Limnogeology (IAL)	JUN 15-19, 2015	Reno, NV					Wetter climatic conditions prevailed across northern and Equatorial Africa during the terminal Pleistocene until the middle Holocene, a climate event known as the "African Humid Period" (AHP). Although hydrologic changes during this period are well-known, very few records of temperature are available for evaluating the mechanisms and dynamics of climate change during the AHP across tropical Africa. To quantify changes in temperature during the onset and termination of the AHP, the TEX86 temperature proxy was used to generate a 14,000 year record of the surface temperature of Lake Turkana. This biomarker and related measures have been used to reconstruct regional and high-latitude paleotemperatures from the oceans and other continental systems, including other large African lakes. Although Lake Turkana's climate and hydrology are very different from other large African lakes, our reconstruction exhibits a temperature history that shares a number of climatic trends with previous reconstructions. The TEX86 temperatures from Lake Turkana from 14 to 0.4 ka range from 24.3 to 28.6 A degrees C, with a gradual decrease in temperature from early to late Holocene. This cooling roughly follows northern hemisphere summer insolation, similar to the trend observed in Lake Victoria and other regional records. However, the record from Turkana contains many abrupt temperature shifts not seen in other large lakes in the region. Multi-century-scale fluctuations persist through most of the record, and can be attributed to periods of lake mixing. Larger temperature perturbations are likely associated with changes in evaporation and cloud cover.																			0921-2728	1573-0417				JAN	2018	59	1			SI		103	117		10.1007/s10933-016-9939-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-016-9939-6													WOS:000419899700007
J	Li, XQ; Zhao, C; Zhou, XY				Li, Xiaoqiang; Zhao, Chao; Zhou, Xinying			Vegetation pattern of Northeast China during the special periods since the Last Glacial Maximum	SCIENCE CHINA-EARTH SCIENCES												Since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), the global climate has experienced several stages, such as cold and warming events, which provide an ideal model for evaluating climate change in the future. Based on the pollen records in Northeast (NE) China, the vegetation pattern during special periods since the LGM was reconstructed in this work. During the LGM (approximately 18,000 cal yr BP), the steppes expanded rapidly in NE China, and a cold-dry meadow-steppe developed on the Songnen Plain. The Liaohe Plain and the Hulun Buir Plateau were occupied by a steppe-desert, with forest-steppe vegetation grown in the central and southern plains; there were cold-dry coniferous forests and mixed conifer-broadleaf forests in mountainous areas. In the early Holocene (10,000-9,000 cal yr BP), Changbai mountain (CBM) forests thrived in the eastern hilly area and the Sanjiang Plain, while the central region was dominated by steppes, and warm-temperate broadleaf forests developed northward. During the Holocene warm period (approximately 6,000 cal yr BP), CBM forests and cold-temperate coniferous forests developed in the north, while spruce-fir forests developed in the eastern Xiao Hinggan Mountains and the Sanjiang Plain. The distribution centre of deciduous broadleaf forests migrated to the south of the Changbai Mountains and the Liaodong Peninsula. The isolated woodlands increased on the Songnen Plain and the meadow-steppes expanded to the Liaohe Plain. Therefore, the increase in temperature leads to the increase of monsoon precipitation in NE China, which is beneficial to the development of warm-temperate forest vegetation. The increase of summer monsoons and precipitation caused by climate warming may be the main reason for the improved plant load.

J	Shrestha, AB; Aryal, R				Shrestha, Arun B.; Aryal, Raju			Climate change in Nepal and its impact on Himalayan glaciers	REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE												Climate change can be particularly hard-hitting for small underdeveloped countries, relying heavily on natural resources for the economy and livelihoods. Nepal is one among these countries, being landlocked, with diverse physiographical characteristics within a relatively small territory and with rugged terrain. Poverty is widespread and the capacity of people and the country to cope with climate change impact is low. The country is dominated by the Asian monsoon system. The main occupation is agriculture, largely based on rain-fed farming practices. Tourism based on high altitude adventures is one of the major sources of income for the country. Nepal has a large hydropower potential. While only 0.75% of the theoretical hydropower potential has been tapped, Nepal can greatly benefit from this natural resource in the future. Climate change can adversely impact upon water resources and other sectors of Nepal. The source of water is mainly summer monsoon precipitation and the melting of the large reserve of snow and glaciers in the Himalayan highlands. Observations show clear evidences of significant warming. The average trend in the country is 0.06 degrees C per year. The warming rates are progressively higher for high elevation locations. The warming climate has resulted in rapid shrinking of majority of glaciers in Nepal. This paper presents state-of-knowledge on the glacial dynamics in the country based on studies conducted in the past in Shorong, Khumbu, Langtang, Dhaulagiri and Kanchenjunga regions of Nepal. We present recent trends in river flow and an overview of studies on expected changes in the hydrological regime due to climate change. Formation, growth and likely outburst of glacial lake are phenomena directly related to climate change and deglaciation. This paper provides a synopsis of past glacial lake outburst floods impacting Nepal. Further, likely impacts of climate change on other sectors such as agriculture, biodiversity, human health and livelihoods are discussed.

Technological approaches to overcome the scale challenges have primarily been adapted from oceanographic applications and technologies, and from upscaling inland lake methods designed for shallower and calmer water bodies. Many standard methods for studying Great Lakes habitat and biota have long lag times between field collection and data availability. Many also miss much of the dynamics, three-dimensional complexity, and spatial variability needed to manage the system effectively. Even baseline conditions are not well characterized for many parts of the Great Lakes ecosystem (e.g. bathymetry and critical habitat, life cycles and food webs, night and winter movement and activity of organisms). Emerging technologies are beginning to address these needs but require coordination, consistent investment, training, and governance linkages. Here we survey recent technological advances and show how they are contributing to improved adaptive management of the Great Lakes ecosystem by reducing uncertainty and increasing understanding of physical, biological, and chemical processes, and the human dimensions of resource management and restoration.

Lough Neagh is one of the most important non-estuarine sites in the British Isles for overwintering wildfowl. A change in the waterbird assemblage following the winter of 2000/2001 was driven mainly by a rapid decline in the population of overwintering diving ducks. Sudden and discrete changes in resident as well as migratory waterbirds may suggest an intrinsic cause. 2. We compared the density and biomass of benthic macroinvertebrates, the food of overwintering diving ducks, in 2010 (following the diving duck population decline) with values from a baseline survey conducted in 1997/1998 (before the decline in diving ducks). 3. The mean total density of macroinvertebrates declined significantly by c. 65% from 15300m(-2) in 1997/1998 to 5136m(-2) in 2010. There was a concomitant c. 70% decline in mean macroinvertebrate biomass from 15667mg m (-2) to 5112mgm(-2). In terms of taxonomic composition, the relative contribution of Tanypodinae, Glyptotendipes spp. and Tanytarsini declined, while the relative contribution of Chironomus spp. increased. 4. We describe a shift in chlorophyll-a concentration, a proxy of phytoplankton biomass, in the largest freshwater lake in the British Isles coincident with a significant reduction in macroinvertebrate density and biomass, with potential implications for ecosystem processes and ecologically and economically important consumer populations, including waterbirds and fishes.

The relationship between anxiety and acute mountain sickness	PLOS ONE												Introduction Whilst the link between physical factors and risk of high altitude (HA)-related illness and acute mountain sickness (AMS) have been extensively explored, the influence of psychological factors has been less well examined. In this study we aimed to investigate the relationship between 'anxiety and AMS risk during a progressive ascent to very HA. Methods Eighty health adults were assessed at baseline (848m) and over 9 consecutive altitudes during a progressive trek to 5140m. HA-related symptoms (Lake Louise [LLS] and AMS-C Scores) and state anxiety (State-Trait-Anxiety-Score [STAI Y-1]) were examined at each altitude with trait anxiety (STAI Y-2) at baseline. Results The average age was 32.1 +/- 8.3 years (67.5% men). STAI Y-1 scores fell from 848m to 3619m, before increasing to above baseline scores (848m) at >= 4072m (p = 0.01). STAI Y-1 scores correlated with LLS (r = 0.31; 0.24-0.3; P<0.0001) and AMS-C Scores (r = 0.29; 0.22-0.35; P<0.0001). There was significant main effect for sex (higher STAI Y-1 scores in women) and altitude with no sex-x-altitude interaction on STAI Y-1 Scores. Independent predictors of significant state anxiety included female sex, lower age, higher heart rate and increasing LLS and AMS-C scores (p<0.0001). A total of 38/80 subjects (47.5%) developed AMS which was mild in 20 (25%) and severe in 18 (22.5%). Baseline STAI Y-2 scores were an independent predictor of future severe AMS (B = 1.13; 1.009-1.28; p = 0.04; r(2) = 0.23) and STAI Y-1 scores at HA independently predicted AMS and its severity. Conclusion Trait anxiety at low altitude was an independent predictor of future severe AMS development at HA. State anxiety at HA was independently associated with AMS and its severity.

Samples were analyzed for water-soluble, acid (pH = 2) soluble and insoluble (bound) P. The term available P was used to indicate the sum of the water- and acid-soluble fractions of P in each type of input. Of the integrated fallout samples, approximately 1/3 was present as available P. The deposition rate for dry fallout of available P was 1.7 ng cm-2 day-1. The wet deposition rate was estimated to be 2.2 ng cm-2 day-1 for available P. Total fallout of available P, determined from shore-based integrated fallout collectors, occurred at a rate of 6.5 ng cm-2 day-1. The difference between the wet-plus-dry deposition and the integrated deposition rates was ascribed to the contamination of integrated fallout collectors by local sources (roads, agricultural activity, etc.) though attempts were made to minimize this problem. The presence of large quantities of biological material (pollen, algae, insect larvae) accounted for a large fraction of the difference observed, especially in the spring months.																			0049-6979	1573-2932					1978	10	2					187	198		10.1007/BF00464714	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00464714													WOS:A1978FX87000005

Hurricanes as a Major Driver of Coastal Erosion in the Mississippi River Delta: A Multi-Decadal Analysis of Shoreline Retreat Rates at Bay Champagne, Louisiana (USA)	WATER												The Louisiana shoreline is rapidly retreating as a result of factors such as sea-level rise and land subsidence. The northern Gulf of Mexico coast is also a hotspot for hurricane landfalls, and several major storms have impacted this region in the past few decades. A section of the Louisiana (USA) coast that has one of the highest rates of shoreline retreat in North America is the Caminada-Moreau headland, located south of New Orleans. Bay Champagne is a coastal lake within the headland that provides a unique opportunity to investigate shoreline retreat and the coastal effects of hurricanes. In order to examine the influence of hurricanes on the rate of shoreline retreat, 35 years (1983-2018) of Landsat imagery was analyzed. During that period of time, the shoreline has retreated 292 m. The overall rate of shoreline retreat, prior to a beach re-nourishment project completed in 2014, was over 12 m per year. A period of high hurricane frequency (1998-2013) corresponds to an increased average shoreline retreat rate of > 21 m per year. Coastal features created by multiple hurricanes that have impacted this site have persisted for several years. Bay Champagne has lost 48% of its surface area over the last 35 years as a result of long-term shoreline retreat. If shoreline retreat continues at the average rate, it is expected that Bay Champagne will disappear completely within the next 40 years.

The development of artificial lakes and constructed wetlands in nutrient-rich rivers is a widely used management tool in the fight to decrease eutrophication. Juvenile salmonids that have to negotiate these lakes during their downstream migration to the sea are commonly subjected to high mortality due to increased predation pressure and delayed passage. In this study, we double tagged 39 brown trout smolts with passive integrated transponder and radio tags to gain further insight into predation rates and migration patterns during their passage of an artificial lake in a Danish lowland stream in the spring of 2016. Thirty-four of the tagged smolts, caught and released upstream, entered the lake, of which 22 (65%) successfully exited the lake. Four smolts (12%) returned upstream to the river. Three smolts were predated in the lake by two northern pike (Esox lucius). Three tags were recovered from the lake bottom, and two disappeared out of the study area after a last detection in the lake. Tracking the smolts manually and by automatic listening stations showed highly erratic movement patterns during lake passage. Further, we observed long delays of up to 27days after the smolts reached the river mouth and before they entered the sea, potentially due to low sea water temperature or due to the stocking of a large amount of hatchery-reared brown trout smolts. The results are discussed in the context of abiotic and biotic factors, which differed considerably in the year 2016 compared with previous years.

However, related studies on the different types of reservoirs are still inadequate. Therefore, we sampled the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR), a typical river-type reservoir having both river and lake characteristics, using an online system (HydroCTM/CO2) and YSI-6600v2 meter to determine the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO(2)) and physical chemical parameters in 2013. The results showed that the CO2 flux from the mainstream ranged from 26.1 to 92.2 mg CO2/m(2) h with average CO2 fluxes of 50.0 mg/m(2) h. The CO2 fluxes from the tributary ranged from -10.91 to 53.95 mg CO2/m(2) h with area-weighted average CO2 fluxes of 11.4 mg/m(2) h. The main stream emits CO2 to the atmosphere the whole year; however, the surface water of the tributary can sometimes act as a sink of CO2 for the atmosphere. As the operation of the TGR, the tributary became more favorable to photosynthetic uptake of CO2 especially in summer. The total CO2 flux was estimated to be 0.34 and 0.03 Tg CO2/year from the mainstream and the tributaries, respectively. Our emission rates are lower than previous estimates, but they are in agreement with the average CO2 flux from temperate reservoirs estimated by Barros et al. (Nat Geosci 4(9):593-596, 2011).

Remote assessment of reserve capacity of outburst alpine lakes	LED I SNEG-ICE AND SNOW												Results of distant satellite sounding (the TERRA satellite) of high-mountainous areas and digital models SRTM 4.1 and ASTER DEM G2 of the same relief were used to calculate the following parameters of high-mountain dammed glacial lakes: area, depth, the water volume, excess of the dam above the water level. It is important for estimation of the water volume that can be dangerous for a break-through of a dammed lake. Formulas deduced to calculate the depth and volume of a lake for several sections of its area were tested and proposed. It is demonstrated that the regression equation V = H-max x F, where H-max is maximum depth of the lake, can be used as the parameterization of the formula "lake volume V equals the product of the area F on average depth D". More precise values of the coefficients a and b in the formula V = aF(b) were also obtained. Parameters and the water volumes of lakes were estimated for the river Gunt (right tributary of Pyanj River) basin. According to [28], there are 428 high-mountain lakes in this region with their total area >= 2500 m(2). For basin Inflow of melted snow and glacier water caused by the rise of mean summer air temperatures in 1931-2015 was estimated for the lake Rivankul basin (the Pamir Mountains).

J	Zeng, Y; Tang, JQ; Lian, S; Tong, DM; Hu, CW				Zeng, Yan; Tang, Jinqiang; Lian, Shuang; Tong, Dongmei; Hu, Changwei			Study on the conversion of cyanobacteria of Taihu Lake water blooms to biofuels	BIOMASS & BIOENERGY												A large amount of cyanobacteria of water blooms pose a considerable threat to the water ecological balance, as well as human health, which are intractable to deal with. The objective of this paper is to utilize cyanobacteria of water blooms in Taihu Lake (CTL) as bioenergy resource to obtain fuel precursors, and simultaneously provide a way to mitigate the environmental burdens of Taihu Lake. The conversion of CTL collected in 2010 summer to biofuels via direct pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis and transesterification was studied. The yield of organic bio-oil from direct pyrolysis (BODP) was 32.3 wt%, and 28.3% of the BODP were aromatic compounds. The catalytic pyrolysis over HZSM-5 produced 30.5 wt% organic bio-oil (BOCP), in which there were lower nitrogenous compound content (33.7% vs. 40.6%), lower oxygenic compound content (21.2% vs. 27.3%), and higher aromatic content (43.4% vs. 28.3%) compared to BODP, and the heat value of BOCP was as high as 32.60 MJ kg(-1). The results demonstrate that the use of CTL, a potential environmental threat, to produce value-added fuel is an applicable approach to generate fuel precursors, especially via catalytic pyrolysis. The result might be helpful to find a possible strategy for use of byproducts of green tide as feedstok for bio-oil production, which should be beneficial for environmental protection and renewable energy development.

Reorganization of algal communities in the Lake of the Woods (Ontario, Canada) in response to turn-of-the-century damming and recent warming	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Paleolimnological approaches were used to assess the ecological and environmental implications of diatom assemblage compositional changes recorded over the last similar to 200 yr from four sites in the Lake of the Woods (LoW), Ontario, Canada. Comparisons between a reference site (Whitefish Bay) and three disturbed sites (Bigstone Bay, Paleolimnological Project site No. 1, and Forrest Island) provide insights into the effects that multiple stressors (dam construction, total phosphorus [TP] changes, and recent warming) have had on the ecology of this highly complex freshwater system. Overall patterns of diatom compositional changes from high-resolution Pb-210-dated sediment cores revealed a strong temporal coherence ca. 1910 and then again over the last few decades among all sites. Hydromanagement activities at the turn of the 19th century and recent warming over the last few decades played key roles in the LoW diatom changes. Diatom compositional changes at all sites were significantly related to trends in nearby air temperature records over the past century and to changes in lake ice phenology over the past similar to 40 yr from Whitefish Bay. Turn-of-the-century hydromanagement activities do not appear to have had long-term effects on diatom-inferred TP (DI-TP), particularly at the disturbed sites. Clear decreases in DI-TP over the last few decades were evident at all sites, but at the reference site these decreases were well below pre-disturbance levels, which we link in part to recent warming. Substantial changes in climate will amplify the effects of multiple stressors on lake water properties that have major implications on algal communities.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				NOV	2010	55	6					2433	2451		10.4319/lo.2010.55.6.2433	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2010.55.6.2433													WOS:000287844700017

Late Quaternary hydrological dynamics in the Middle Kalahari: Forcing and feedbacks	EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS												The Kalahari region has become a major source of Quaternary palaeoenvironmental data derived primarily from the analysis of geomorphological proxies of environmental change. One suite of data, from palaeolacustrine landforms, has recently provided a new record of major hydrological changes in the last 150 ka [Burrough, S. L., Thomas, D. S. G., Bailey, R. M., 2009. Mega-Lake in the Kalahari: A Late Pleistocene record of the Palaeolake Makgadikgadi system. Quaternary Science Reviews, in press.]. Here we present an improved analysis of the drivers and feedbacks of lake level change, utilising information from three main sources: data from the lake system itself, from analyses of other late Quaternary records within the region and from climate modelling. Simulations using the Hadley Centre coupled climate model, HadCM3, suggest that once triggered, the lake body was large enough to potentially affect both local and regional climates. Surface waters and their interactions with the climate are therefore an important component of environmental dynamics during the late Quaternary. Through its capacity to couple Middle Kalahari environments to distant forcing mechanisms and to itself force environmental change, we demonstrate that the existence or absence of megalake Makgadikgadi adds a new level of complexity to the interpretations of environmental proxy records in southern Africa's summer rainfall zone.

The objective of this study was to develop a highly sensitive and broadly reactive quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay for Arcobacter spp. and to apply the developed assay to different water sources in the Kathmandu Valley, Nepal. Fifteen samples to be analyzed by next-generation sequencing were collected from 13 shallow dug wells, a deep tube well, and a river in the Kathmandu Valley in August 2015. Among the 86 potential pathogenic bacterial genera identified, Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, Flavobacterium, and Arcobacter were detected with relatively high abundance in 15, 14, 12, and 8 samples, respectively. A primer pair was designed with maximal nucleotide homologies among Arcobacter spp. by comparing the sequences of 16S rRNA genes. These primers were highly specific to most of the known species of Arcobacter and quantified between 1.0x10(1) and 6.4x10(6) copies reaction(-1) and sometimes detected as few as 3 copies reaction(-1). The qPCR assay was used to quantify Arcobacter spp. in bacterial DNA in not only the above 15 water samples, but also in 33 other samples collected from 15 shallow dug wells, 6 shallow tube wells, 5 stone spouts, 4 deep tube wells, and 3 springs. Thirteen (27%) out of 48 samples tested were positive for Arcobacter spp., with concentrations of 5.3-9.1 log copies 100 mL(-1). This qPCR assay represents a powerful new tool to assess the prevalence of Arcobacter spp. in environmental water samples.

Shallow water communities, mostly dominated by Isoetes alpinus Kirk, extend to a depth of about 4 m, but do not grow above 0.7 m because of strong wave action. Mid-depth communities consist of a tall Elodea canadensis Michx./Myriophyllum triphyllum Orchard community between 2 and 4 m at the shallow northern end of the lake, large areas of Chara fibrosa var. acanthopitys (A.Br). Zenev. at the southern end, and a M. triphyllum/Nitella hookeri A.Br. community at 2-6 on the steeply descending eastern and western sides of the lake. Pure stands of E. canadensis may replace the last community, particularly on the eastern side. A deep water characean community of C. globularis Thruill. and C. corallina Kl. ex Willd. extends from 4 m to 10-11 m with 100% cover; C. corallina continuing sparsely to 16 m.

More than 850 New York State divers were surveyed during the fall of 1999, ranging from novices to experts and post-experts. Particular emphasis was placed on measuring extent of agreement with statements that focused on the use and preservation of underwater artifacts, which implicitly involved issues related to accessibility of abandoned shipwrecks. Although divers of all levels of development did tend to share certain beliefs, ascriptions of responsibility, and management preferences, the strength of agreement with half of the statements did differ by level of development. The predicted pattern of increasing in strength from beginner to expert and declining again for post-expert stages was supported in nine cases, while post-experts continued a more direct linear relationship with three items. in these particular cases, a "history effect" may have had an influence on post-expert divers. The results of this study documented the need for continuing support to educate divers on safe and responsible use of underwater resources.																									2000	276						131	140																WOS:000167585900021

Developing and mature plasmodia were detected on the gills exclusively in the spring. The Myxobolus intimus infection was found only in 2- to 3-year-old fish. In histological sections, young plasmodia were found in capillaries of the secondary lamellae. More mature, round plasmodia 0.4-0.6 mm in diameter, deformed the respiratory lamellae. The intraoligochacte development of M. intimus was studied in experimentally infected oligochaetes. In two experiments, uninfected Tubifex tubifex Muller and Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri (Claparede) were exposed to mature myxospores of M. intimus. In both experiments, typical triactinospores developed in T. tubifex specimens but no infection was found in L. hoffmeisteri. In semithin sections, developmental stages, pansporocysts and actinospores, were found within the proliferated gut epithelium of T. tubifex. Triactinospores were first released from oligochaetes 37 and 58 days after initial exposure in the two experiments, respectively. Each triactinospore had three pyriform polar capsules and a cylindrical sporoplasm with 32 secondary cells. The spore body joined the 3 caudal projections with a moderately long style.

The abundance of heterocystous genera (communities 1 and 3) implies that N-2 fixation plays an important role in the nitrogen economy of these ecosystems. Most of the communities were rich in pigments absorbing in the UV-blue end of the spectrum, such as scytonemin and mycosporine-like amino acids. Spectroradiometric analyses of sections of the communities showed that short wavelength radiation did not reach the bottom layer where phycobiliprotein-rich cells were located. This lower community experienced low irradiance in the photosynthetically active radiation band (400-700 nm), restricted to the wavelengths of the yellow-red waveband (550-650 nm). The surface screening of high energy wavelengths may confer an adaptive advantage to these communities which grow under continuous light during the polar summer.

Here we explore the influence of environmental conditions and the proximity to anthropogenic sources on the concentration and composition of dissolved black carbon (DBC), as measured by benzenepolycaroxylic acid (BPCA) markers, across snow, lakes, and streams from the global cryosphere. Data are presented from Antarctica, the Arctic, and high alpine regions of the Himalayas, Rockies, Andes, and Alps. DBC concentrations spanned from 0.62 mu g/L to 170 mu g/L. The median and (2.5, 97.5) quantiles in the pristine samples were 1.8 mu g/L (0.62, 12), and nonpristine samples were 21 mu g/L (1.6, 170). DBC is susceptible to photodegradation when exposed to solar radiation. This process leads to a less condensed BPCA signature. In general, DBC across the data set was composed of less polycondensed DBC. However, DBC from the Greenland Ice Sheet (GRIS) had a highly condensed BPCA molecular signature. This could be due to recent deposition of BC from Canadian wildfires. Variation in DBC appears to be driven by a combination of photochemical processing and the source combustion conditions under which the DBC was formed. Overall, DBC was found to persist across the global cryosphere in both pristine and nonpristine snow and surface waters. The high concentration of DBC measured in supraglacial melt on the GRIS suggests that DBC can be mobilized across ice surfaces. This is significant because these processes may jointly exacerbate surface albedo reduction in the cryosphere. Plain Language Summary Here we present dissolved black carbon (DBC) results for snow and glacial melt systems in Antarctica, the Arctic, and high alpine regions of the Himalayas, Rockies, Andes, and Alps. Across the global cryosphere, DBC composition appears to be a result of photochemical processes occurring en route in the atmosphere or in situ on the snow or ice surface, as well as the combustion conditions under which the DBC was formed. We show that samples from the Greenland Ice Sheet (GRIS) have a distinct molecular chemical signature, consistent with deposition of BC from Canadian wildfires occurring the week before sampling. The concentration range observed in this global cryosphere study indicates significant amounts of DBC persist in both pristine and human-impacted snow and glacial meltwater. Our results are significant for understanding the controls on meltwater production from glaciers worldwide and the feedbacks between combustion sources, wildfires, and the global cryosphere. Wildfires are predicted to increase due to climate change, and albedo cannibalism is already influencing meltwater generation on the GRIS. Anticipated longer summer melt seasons as a result of climate change may result in longer durations between snowfalls, enhancing exposure of recalcitrant DBC on snow/ice surfaces, which could further exacerbate surface albedo reduction in the cryosphere.					; Xian, Peng/Q-4159-2019	Wagner, Sasha/0000-0001-6184-5734; MCKNIGHT, DIANE/0000-0002-4171-1533; Khan, Alia/0000-0002-4425-1528; Xian, Peng/0000-0001-7602-0524													0094-8276	1944-8007				JUN 28	2017	44	12					6226	6234		10.1002/2017GL073485	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2017GL073485													WOS:000405854200041

However, only few standardized datasets describe concentrations of these gases in lakes across different geographical regions. We studied concentrations and stable carbon isotopic composition (delta C-13) of CH4 and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in 32 small lakes from Finland, Sweden, Germany, the Netherlands, and Switzerland in late summer. Higher concentrations and delta C-13 values of DIC were observed in calcareous lakes than in lakes on non-calcareous areas. In stratified lakes, delta C-13 values of DIC were generally lower in the hypolimnion due to the degradation of organic matter (OM). Unexpectedly, increased delta C-13 values of DIC were registered above the sediment in several lakes. This may reflect carbonate dissolution in calcareous lakes or methanogenesis in deepwater layers or in the sediments. Surface water CH4 concentrations were generally higher in western and central European lakes than in Fennoscandian lakes, possibly due to higher CH4 production in the littoral sediments and lateral transport, whereas CH4 concentrations in the hypolimnion did not differ significantly between the regions. The delta C-13 values of CH4 in the sediment suggest that delta C-13 values of biogenic CH4 are not necessarily linked to delta C-13 values of sedimentary OM but may be strongly influenced by OM quality and methanogenic pathway. Our study suggests that CH4 and DIC cycling in small lakes differ between geographical regions and that this should be taken into account when regional studies on greenhouse gas emissions are upscaled to inter-regional scales.

The presence of gas fumeroles, hot springs, and hydrothermal alteration zones indicates that the area is geothermally active. The products of the maar are large blocks and lapilli to coarse ash. Planar bedding and cross-stratification are well developed within coarse ash beds. The maar deposits were generated by a single period of phreatomagmatic explosion with two episodes. The first episode produced wet eruption clouds, while the second one was relatively dry in nature. The estimate of the volume of pyroclastic ejecta compared with the dimensions of the maar demonstrates a material deficiency, which is attributed to a large volume of gas emanated during the phnatomagmatic explosion along a fault presently cross-cutting the maar. In addition, a relatively small volume of magma intruded along the fault and mixed with meteoric water in the fault zone to produce the phreatomagmatic eruption. The existence of a hydrothermal system in the fault zone is important in affecting the eruption style and evolution of Narkoy maar. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Järvinen, M; Salonen, K				Järvinen, M; Salonen, K			Influence of changing food web structure on nutrient limitation of phytoplankton in a highly humic lake	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												We determined the potential nutrient limitation of summer phytoplankton production using 2 x 2 x 2 factorial design of enrichment bioassays both before and after the introduction of planktivorous whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus) in a polyhumic lake with an abundant population of the large cladoceran Daphnia longispina. After the fish introduction, Daphnia disappeared and was substituted by the rotifer Keratella cochlearis. During the dominance of Daphnia, additions of nutrients had little or no effect on primary production of phytoplankton in short-term (1-day) incubations. However, 5-day incubations suggested that P most likely was the limiting nutrient. After the fish introduction, both 1- and 5-day enrichment bioassays indicated potential N limitation of phytoplankton production. The strong response of phytoplankton production to combined enrichments with P and N also suggested colimitation by P and N, but this was probably forced by the relatively high additions of nutrients. Consistently low primary production after the combined addition of P and glucose suggests that in the presence of a labile organic C source, epilimnetic bacteria were superior to algae in the uptake of P. Our results suggest that changes in the food web structure may determine the limiting nutrient also in a highly humic lake.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				DEC	1998	55	12					2562	2571																WOS:000078455500004

Seroprevalence, risk factors and spatial distribution of West Nile virus in Jordan	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE												Background This is the first countrywide study of the seroprevalence, risk factors and spatial distribution of West Nile virus (WNV) in Jordan. Methods A cross-sectional sample of 801 participants was administered a comprehensive questionnaire survey and tested for WNV immunoglobulin G antibodies. Results The point seroprevalence rate for WNV infection was 8.61% (95% confidence interval 6.8 to 10.8). Multivariate regression analysis demonstrated that sex, age, climate, income and drinking water source were significantly associated with seropositivity (p0.05). Males had 1.73 greater odds of infection compared with females. Compared with 15 to 29-year-olds, adults 30-49 y old and adults 50 y old had 2.0 and 3.1 greater odds of infection, respectively. Individuals living in the Jordan Valley and Badia had 22.2 and 7.2 times greater odds of infection, respectively, compared with individuals living in the highlands. Households with an income of <US$750/month had 1.8 greater odds of infection compared with those with higher household incomes. Individuals using spring lakes as a drinking water source had 5.1 greater odds of infection than people who used water from any other source. Conclusions This study demonstrates that WNV is circulating in Jordan and should be considered as a differential diagnosis in medical cases presenting with nervous system symptoms, especially for older populations living in the Jordan Valley and Badia areas.

Measurement and modeling of ablation of the bottom of supraglacial lakes in western Greenland	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												We report measurements of ablation rates of the bottom of two supraglacial lakes and of temperatures at different depths collected during the summers of 2010 and 2011 in west Greenland. To our knowledge, this is the first time that such data sets are reported and discussed in the literature. The measured ablation rates at the bottom of the two lakes are of the order of similar to 6 cm/day, versus a rate of similar to 2.5-3 cm/day in the case of bare ice of surrounding areas. Though our measurements suggest the presence of a vertical temperature gradient, it is not possible to draw final conclusions as the measured gradient is smaller than the accuracy of our temperature sensors. In-situ measurements are compared with the results of a thermodynamic model forced with the outputs of a regional climate model. In general, the model is able to satisfactorily reproduce the measured quantities with RMSE of the order of 3-4 cm for the ablation and similar to 1.5 degrees C in the case of water temperature. Our results confirm that the ablation at the bottom of supraglacial lakes plays an important role on the overall lake volume with the ablation in the case of ice covered by a lake being 110-135% of that over bare ice at nearby locations. Beside ice sheet hydrological implications, melting at the bottom of a supraglacial lake might affect estimates of lake volume from spaceborne visible and near-infrared measurements.

J	Kamjunke, N; Gaedke, U; Tittel, J; Weithoff, G; Bell, EM				Kamjunke, N; Gaedke, U; Tittel, J; Weithoff, G; Bell, EM			Strong vertical differences in the plankton composition of an extremely acidic lake	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												|Abstract: Vertical differences in food web structure were examined in an extremely acidic, iron-rich mining lake in Germany (Lake 111; pH 2.6, total Fe 150 mg L-1) during the period of stratification. We tested whether or not the seasonal variation of the plankton composition is less pronounced than the differences observed over depth. The lake was strongly stratified in summer, and concentrations of dissolved organic carbon and inorganic carbon were consistently low in the epilimnion but high in the hypolimnion. Oxygen concentrations declined in the hypolimnion but were always above 2 mg L-1. Light attenuation did not change over depth and time and was governed by dissolved ferric iron. The plankton consisted mainly of single-celled and filamentous bacteria, the two mixotrophic flagellates Chlamydomonas sp. and Ochromonas sp., the two rotifer species Elosa worallii and Cephalodella hoodi, and Heliozoa as top predators. We observed very few ciliates and rhizopods, and no heterotrophic flagellates, crustaceans or fish. Ochromonas sp., bacterial filaments, Elosa and Heliozoa dominated in the epilimnion whereas Chlamydomonas sp., single-celled bacteria and Cephalodella dominated in the hypolimnion. Single-celled bacteria were controlled by Ochromonas sp. whereas the lack of large consumers favoured a high proportion of bacterial filaments. The primarily phototrophic Chlamydomas sp. was limited by light and CO2 and may have been reduced due to grazing by Ochromonas sp. in the epilimnion. The distribution of the primarily phagotrophic Ochromonas sp. and of the animals seemed to be controlled by prey availability. Differences in the plankton composition were much higher between the epilimnion and hypolimnion than within a particular stratum over time. The food web in Lake Ill was extremely species-poor enabling no functional redundancy. This was attributed to the direct exclusion of species by the harsh environmental conditions and presumably enforced by competitive exclusion. The latter was promoted by the low diversity at the first trophic level which, in turn, was attributed to relatively stable growth conditions and the independence of resource availability (inorganic carbon and light) from algal density. Ecological theory suggests that low functional redundancy promotes low stability in ecosystem processes which was not supported by our data.

J	PERROW, MR; MOSS, B; STANSFIELD, J				PERROW, MR; MOSS, B; STANSFIELD, J			TROPHIC INTERACTIONS IN A SHALLOW LAKE FOLLOWING A REDUCTION IN NUTRIENT LOADING - A LONG-TERM STUDY	HYDROBIOLOGIA												After the diversion of a nutrient-rich inflow, the eutrophic lake, Alderfen Broad, initially showed reduced total phosphorus concentrations and phytoplankton populations, clear water and the establishment of submerged macrophytes. Internal P loading then increased, perhaps stimulated by the senescence of submerged macrophytes and exacerbated by the lack of flushing. Cyanophytes appeared in the summer of two years. As a consequence of poor recruitment of roach (Rutilus rutilus (L.)), the chief zooplanktivore, and a summerkill of the fish population, populations of large-bodied Cladocera (Daphnia hyalina/longispina and ultimately D. magna) developed. In the long-term, these may have limited the further development of phytoplankton populations and clear water and submerged macrophytes returned. During this latter period, internal P release has remained high (> 3 80 mug l-1), thereby indicating the scope for biomanipulation even in eutrophic conditions. However, isolation of the lake has led to a decrease in water level (which through increased temperatures and lowered dissolved oxygen levels was probably responsible for the fish deaths) and further concentration of internal P load. Sediment is now being removed to reestablish greater water depth.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				FEB 25	1994	275						43	52		10.1007/BF00026698	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00026698													WOS:A1994NB19800005

We present observations from the Lowell Discovery Telescope and multiple meteor camera networks of 2022 WJ1, an Earth impactor that was disrupted over the North American Great Lakes on 2022 November 19. As far as we are aware, this is only the second time an Earth impactor has been specifically observed in multiple passbands prior to impact to characterize its composition. The orbits derived from telescopic observations submitted to the Minor Planet Center and ground-based meteor cameras result in impact trajectories that agree to within 40 m, but no meteorites have been found as of yet. The telescopic observations suggest a silicate-rich surface and thus a moderate-to-high albedo, which results in an estimated size for the object of just D = 40-60 cm. Modeling the fragmentation of 2022 WJ1 during its fireball phase also suggests an approximate 0.5 m original size for the object as well as an ordinary chondrite-like strength. These two lines of evidence both support that 2022 WJ1 was likely an S-type chondritic object and the smallest asteroid compositionally characterized in space. We discuss how best to combine telescopic and meteor camera data sets, how well these techniques agree, and what can be learned from studies of ultrasmall asteroids.					; Micheli, Marco/H-7598-2015; Brown, Peter/C-8763-2018; kim, Theodore/HLQ-4764-2023; Devillepoix, Hadrien/MHQ-1632-2025	Brown, Peter/0000-0001-6130-7039; Moskovitz, Nicholas/0000-0001-6765-6336; Vida, Denis/0000-0003-4166-8704; Wiegert, Paul/0000-0002-1914-5352; Micheli, Marco/0000-0001-7895-8209; McCausland, Phil/0000-0003-3030-7524; Kareta, Theodore/0000-0003-1008-7499; Devillepoix, Hadrien/0000-0001-9226-1870; 														2632-3338				NOV 1	2024	5	11							253	10.3847/PSJ/ad8b22	http://dx.doi.org/10.3847/PSJ/ad8b22													WOS:001361183500001

Dechlorane plus and other flame retardants in a sediment core from Lake Ontario	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Our previous research on atmospheric samples suggested that Lake Ontario might receive significant amounts of Dechlorane Plus (DP), a highly chlorinated flame retardant, from the atmosphere and from inputs from DP's manufacturing facility in Niagara Falls, New York. To confirm this suspicion, a sediment core from the central basin of Lake Ontario was analyzed for the two isomers of DP, for polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and for 1,2-bis(2,4,6-tribromophenoxy)ethane (TBE). The results showed that the concentration of DP in sediment increased rapidly starting in the mid-1970s and reached its peak concentration (310 ng g(-1) dry weight) in the mid-1990s. The peak flux and total inventory of DP were estimated to be 9.3 ng cm(-2) yr(-1) and 120 ng cm(-2), respectively. These values suggest that the total burden of DP in Lake Ontario is similar to 20 tons and that the maximum load rate was similar to 2 tons per year. The highest concentrations of PBDEs and TBE were found in the surficial sediment, with average concentrations of 2.8, 14, and 6.7 ng g(-1) d.w. for PBDE3-7 (tri- through hepta-BDEs), BDE-209, and TBE, respectively. The surface fluxes were 0.08, 0.43, and 0.20 ng cm(-2) yr(-1), and the inventories were 0.87, 3.9, and 1.8 ng cm(-2) for PBDE3-7, BDE-209, and TBE, respectively. The concentration of DP in Lake Ontario sediment exceeds that of the brominated flame retardants combined.

Beryllium-7 and Pb-210(ex) budgets were used to assess the redistribution of soil and organic debris that occurred on hillslopes in this catchment after the wildfire. In the similar to 90-ha study site, the budgets showed substantial losses of 7 Be from the upper plateau (10 +/- 2%) and side slopes (26 +/- 5%), and deposition on the lower footslopes and alluvial fans (2 +/- 4%). Overall it was possible to account for similar to 65% of the initial amount of Be expected to be present with the balance, 35 +/- 6%, presumably being exported offsite. Construction of a Pb-210(ex) budget showed a similar pattern of internal redistribution; some 28 +/- 6 % of the total amount was exported from the site. Analysis of litter, soil and sediment samples shows that both Be-7 and Pb-210(ex) were: (a) preferentially retained near the soil surface (due to their constant deposition in rainfall), and (b) exhibited an affinity with organic material. It appears that Pb-210 and Be-7 budgets can reveal much about the redistribution of soil, organic (and nutrient) material after fires in these systems.

Representing the acquisition and use of energy by individuals in agent-based models of animal populations	METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Agent-based models (ABMs) are widely used to predict how populations respond to changing environments. As the availability of food varies in space and time, individuals should have their own energy budgets, but there is no consensus as to how these should be modelled. Here, we use knowledge of physiological ecology to identify major issues confronting the modeller and to make recommendations about how energy budgets for use in ABMs should be constructed. Our proposal is that modelled animals forage as necessary to supply their energy needs for maintenance, growth and reproduction. If there is sufficient energy intake, an animal allocates the energy obtained in the order: maintenance, growth, reproduction, energy storage, until its energy stores reach an optimal level. If there is a shortfall, the priorities for maintenance and growth/reproduction remain the same until reserves fall to a critical threshold below which all are allocated to maintenance. Rates of ingestion and allocation depend on body mass and temperature. We make suggestions for how each of these processes should be modelled mathematically. Mortality rates vary with body mass and temperature according to known relationships, and these can be used to obtain estimates of background mortality rate. If parameter values cannot be obtained directly, then values may provisionally be obtained by parameter borrowing, pattern-oriented modelling, artificial evolution or from allometric equations. The development of ABMs incorporating individual energy budgets is essential for realistic modelling of populations affected by food availability. Such ABMs are already being used to guide conservation planning of nature reserves and shell fisheries, to assess environmental impacts of building proposals including wind farms and highways and to assess the effects on nontarget organisms of chemicals for the control of agricultural pests.

Being pregnant with plentiful fish resources, it is not only the representative of the areas with biological diversity, but also a cradle of freshwater fisheries in China. In the Yangtze, at present, the fishery resources are seriously depleted; the fishery yield by fishing is significantly reduced; significant changes have occurred on the structure of fish community, with decrease in migratory fish species, reduction in the quantity of the populations of rare, peculiar and economically important fish species and increase in the number of exotic fish species, and severe trend in fish stunting. Habitat fragmentation and shrinkage, resources overexploitation, water pollution and invasion of exotic species are the main causes for threatening fish stocks in the Yangtze River. Since 1950's, a lot of scientific researches have been conducted on biology of fishes from the Yangtze River and its fisheries to provide scientific basis for their protection. In recent years, measures such as closed spring, fish reserves, artificial enhancement & release, ecological rehabilitation, fishery management and international cooperation have played important roles. Nevertheless, researches on fishes from the Yangtze cannot adequately meet the demand for their protection. Especially, those in the aspects of population ecology of Yangtze fishes, species endangerment mechanism, ecological effects of large hydraulic projects and protection strategy are not deep enough. It is recommended that scientific researches should be conducted in comprehensive survey of Yangtze fish resources, fish endangerment mechanism, techniques in artificial enhancement and release of key species, risk assessment of exotic species, ecological rehabilitation of major fisheries functional zones, etc.						Wei, Jin/0000-0003-2779-5440													0378-1909	1573-5133				AUG	2009	85	4					337	357		10.1007/s10641-009-9517-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-009-9517-0													WOS:000268771800013
J	An, KG				An, KG			Spatial and temporal variabilities of nutrient limitation based on in situ experiments of Nutrient Enrichment Bioassay	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND HEALTH PART A-TOXIC/HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES & ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING												In situ experiments of Nutrient Enrichment Bioassays (NEBs) were performed in a morphologically complex reservoir of a temperate region to identify primary limiting nutrient regulating phytoplankton productivity and determine a severeity of the nutrient limitation. Absolute nutrient contents and nutrient ratios of TN: TP and TDN :TDP in the ambient water indicated a potential limitation of phosphorus. This outcome agreed with the results of NEBs; Algal response in the P treatments, expressed as a ratio of CHLf : CHLi, showed significantly (p < 0.05) greater algal response than P + NH4-N or P + NO3-N treatments. The magnitude of the limitation, however, showed large spatial and temporal variations. The response in treatments enriched with phosphorus (P, P + NH4-N, and P + NO3-N) was greatest in the downlake zone and least in the point-source zone, while the response was greater during summer monsoon than any other seasons. Algal growth rate experiments. showed that the response in treatments enriched with NO3-N and P + NO3-N never exceeded > 0.50 mug L-1 per day and was significantly (p < 0.05) less than that in the three treatments with P (1 P, 2P, and P + NH4-N), indicating a reduced response in the treatments enriched with NO3-N. The suppression of nitrate on algal growth seemed to be involved with inhibition effect of nitrogenase activity through low-nitrate uptake rate in the high nitrate-rich environment and large additions of potassium with phosphorus in spike. Regression analysis of log(10)-transformed CHLf: CHLi ratios against ambient nutrient contents showed that in situ algal response in the P treatments was inversely related (r = - 0.77; p < 0.001) with ambient TP and positively correlated (r = 0.75; p < 0.001) with TN : TP ratios. This result suggests that in situ response depends largely on external loading of limiting nutrients.

Ranges for the mean concentrations of total PAHs (ng m(-3)) were as follows: Villeroy, 3.31-18.92; St. Anicet, 7.57-22.84; and Mingan, 0.50-0.53. Lower molecular weight PAHs predominated at all locations. Particle-gas partition coefficients (K-p) were in good correlation with their vapor pressures (r(2) = 0.79-0.97) with slopes deviating from the expected value of -1. The curve of the fractions of PAHs on particles in St. Anicet in 1995 fell on that of Lake Superior. In St. Anicet, fractions of phenanthrene, fluoranthene, pyrene, and chrysene on particles were close to those calculated from the sootair partition coefficient (K-SA). At all sites the mean ratios of particulate PAH of the same molecular weight but of very different reactivities were similar during the same sampling days, suggesting that particle-bearing PAHs in Villeroy and Mingan were of the same nature as those found in St. Anicet where adsorption onto soot particles was the major mechanism. Furthermore, the enthalpies of desorption for the predominant PAHs were close at all sites.																			0013-936X	1520-5851				MAY 15	2003	37	10					2094	2099		10.1021/es0210345	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es0210345								12785512					WOS:000182866000009
J	Wærvågen, SB; Nilssen, JP				Waervagen, Svein Birger; Nilssen, Jens Petter			Seasonal dynamics and life histories of pelagic cladocerans (Crustacea; Cladocera) in an acid boreal lake	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												In the surveyed anthropogenic acidified Lake Gjerstadvann with pH approximate to 5.2 situated in southern Norway, spatial and temporal distribution of three characteristic planktonic cladocerans inhabiting acidified boreal biotopes, Bosmina longispina, Holopedium gibberum, and Diaphanosoma brachyurum, were studied over a period of one year. The major pelagic predator was Eurasian perch, Perca fluviatilis. The local perch probably balanced the cladoceran community and facilitated co-existence of all three species of cladocerans by removing significant portions of B. longispina, which could also be the case in similar types of boreal lakes. Invertebrate predators such as the dipteran larvae Chaoborus flavicans and carnivorous copepods did not seem to influence the cladoceran community. B. longispina was perennial, whereas both H. gibberum and D. brachyurum were recorded only during the ice-free period. The life cycle of these free-living pelagic species ranged from 2-3 in D. brachyurum, 3 in H. gibberum to approximately 6 annual generations in B. longispina. Wintering took place as resting eggs in D. brachyurum and H. gibberum, while B. longispina produced resting eggs in addition to an active planktonic stay. The warm water tolerant D. brachyurum was mainly distributed above the thermocline, whereas H. gibberum also inhabited deeper strata, and B. longispina most vertical strata of the lake. Maximum seasonal clutch volume of B. longispina coincided in time with peak in food abundance and may be a useful parameter to identify planktonic food availability in such lakes. Knowledge of the autecology and life history of species is fundamental for understanding ecosystem stress, such as anthropogenic acidification and recovery through liming or by natural causes. Seasonal depth isoplots combined with life history studies of commonly co-occurring cladoceran species from natural acid and anthropogenic acidified lakes on the Northern Hemisphere seem to be uncommon, and similar type of data is needed to filly understand the processes of acidification and recovery.																			1129-5767	1723-8633					2011	70	1					83	101		10.4081/jlimnol.2011.83	http://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jlimnol.2011.83													WOS:000294320300011

BC). A possible short glacial period from 2590 +/- 60 to 2140 +/- 60 C-14 yr BP (330-60 cal. BC) is thought to be represented by a thin, grey silt interlayer. After this date, the inflow of glacial meltwater to the lake ceased, indicating that few or no glaciers existed on the Angstrom lfotbreen plateau at that time. A drop in organic-matter content and an associated increase in clastic-material supply at the cure depth of 100 cm may indicate some renewed glacial activity in the lake's catchment from about 1650 +/- 60 C-14 yr BP (cai. AD 370-450). The textural and carbon-content change at about 60 cm depth indicates an increased Neoglacial activity in the catchment from 910 +/- 70 C-14 yr BP (cal. AD 1030-1220). The winter snow-mass balance is the most important factor controlling the net mass balance of Angstrom lfotbreen.																			0029-196X						1995	75	2-3					120	126																WOS:A1995RY96900004

Occurrence, profile and spatial distribution of UV-filters and musk fragrances in mussels from Portuguese coastline	MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												The increasing production and consumption of Personal Care Products (PCPs), containing UV-filters and musk fragrances, has led to its widespread presence in the aquatic environment which can cause harmful effects to the aquatic organisms due to its intrinsic toxicity. This study aims to evaluate the degree of contamination of wild mussels along the entire Portuguese coastline, continually exposed in their habitat to different contaminants. For this purpose, approximately 1000 mussel specimens were sampled during one year in seven different locations, along the Portuguese coastline. Simultaneous quantification of five UV-filters and seven musks in mussels was achieved by a Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged and Safe (QuEChERS) extraction procedure combined with dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (DLLME) followed by gas chromatography with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. Ten out of the twelve target analytes were found in the analysed samples, highlighting the presence of AHTN (tonalide), EHS (2-ethylhexylsalicylate) and EHMC (2-ethylhexyl 4-methoxycinnamate) in all positive samples (93%). Overall, the results obtained indicate a widespread contamination of wild mussels along Portuguese coastline, all over the year. UV-filters were more frequently detected (90%) than musk fragrances (70%) and also quantified at higher levels, with average total concentrations reaching 1155.8 ng/g (dw) against 397.7 ng/g (dw) respectively. A high correlation was observed between the most densely populated and industrialized locations and the higher levels of musks and UV-filters found. In other hand, lower levels of PCPs were found in protected areas. As expected, an increase in UV-filters levels was observed after the summer, likely due to the intense period of recreational activities.

J	Kindaichi, S; Takehara, K; Nishina, D				Kindaichi, Sayaka; Takehara, Keigo; Nishina, Daisaku			Applicability of entrainment law to heat release processes in reservoir-source heat pump systems	APPLIED THERMAL ENGINEERING												Water reservoirs in western Japan have a low temperature around the bottom area during summer, and they can be used as possible renewable heat sources in heat pump systems. Predicting the temperature of the heat source is a significant concern because it directly affects the system efficiency. Although many previous studies have investigated the thermal characteristics of heat exchangers in heat-release processes, little has been reported on the influence of heat release on the thermal stratification of the heat source. In this study, we conducted laboratory experiments involving thermal layers with two different temperatures and measured the temperature variations of the heat source and boundary of the thermal layers. We found that natural convection with a velocity of approximately 1 cm/s, caused by a heat release of 0.7-4.5 kW/m(2) from the bottom, resulted in an increase of the boundary by entrainment, warming only the lower layer uniformly. The measured variations of the lower-layer temperature were reproduced using the entrainment law, which is originally defined for natural phenomena in lakes, with an accuracy of +/- 0.7 degrees C. Using the entrainment law, the heat source temperature in the reservoir-source heat pump systems may be predicted easily without turbulent transfer models.

Phylogenetic analysis of the most common and dominant sequences recovered indicated that these sequences fell into the following major lineages, including Proteobacteria (alpha-, beta-, gamma-), Actinobacteria, Cyanobacteria, Planctomycetes, Fibrobacteres, Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi, and unclassified bacteria. Sequence analysis showed that the bacterial diversity was abundant, and the sequences belonging to beta-Proteobacteria, alpha-Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria were predominant. The most sequences in the saline-alkali rearing ponds exhibited low similarity with known bacterial 16S rRNA genes, suggesting that these sequences may represent novel bacteria. In addition, the majority of our sequences were most closely affiliated with sequences retrieved from inland waters of China. These results suggest that the saline-alkali ponds rearing common carp are specific ecologic niches and the distribution of the bacteria may be influenced by geographical factors. This study reports the bacterial diversity in saline-alkali ponds rearing common carp by the culture-independent technique for the first time; therefore, it provides important information for understanding the microbial ecology in saline-alkali rearing ponds and managing the microbial community composition to promote and maintain the health of aquaculture environments.

The satellite-derived Forel-Ule index (FUI) can actually reflect the comprehensive water color characterization on a large scale; however, the spatial distribution and temporal trends in water color and their drivers remain prevalently elusive. Using the Google Earth Engine platform, this study conducts the Landsat-derived FUI to track the complicated water color dynamics in a large reservoir, i.e., the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR), in China over the past decade. The results show that the distinct patterns of latitudinal FUI distribution are found in the four typical TGR tributaries on the yearly and monthly scales, and the causal relationship between heterogeneous FUI trends and natural/anthropogenic drivers on different temporal scales is highlighted. In addition, the coexistence of phytoplankton bloom and summer flood in the TGR tributaries has been revealed through the hybrid representation of greenish and yellowish schemes. This study is an important step forward in understanding the water quality change in a river-reservoir ecosystem affected by complex coupling drivers on a large spatiotemporal scale.					liu, meiling/LSI-8359-2024															1424-8220				DEC	2024	24	23							7449	10.3390/s24237449	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s24237449								39685986					WOS:001377837300001

While biological and physico-chemical drivers of carbonate precipitation are known, their relative contributions in controlling whiting events' timing and spatial extent remain poorly understood. Coupling spatially resolved data obtained for two sampling surveys using multiple analytical techniques and geochemical modeling, this study investigated the mechanisms underlying a whiting event during the early summer of 2019 in Lake Geneva. Satellite observations showed that the phenomenon started during a snowmelt period in the catchment at the Rhone River delta before spreading along the lake's northern shore and covering vast areas of its deeper basin. Authigenic calcite precipitated at the river mouth during mixing of warmer calcite super-saturated lake surface waters with colder snowmelt-diluted, sediment-rich river water containing detrital carbonates as potential nucleation sites. The development of the whiting event depended upon the thermal stratification of the water column and the existence of a physically stable metalimnion, within which a river interflow transported finer particles across the lake. During transport, the whiting plume enriched in authigenic carbonates by settling of coarser detrital particles and additional precipitation likely both on the fine-grained carbonate fraction and through biologically induced mechanisms in the superficial layers of the lake. This study provides novel mechanistic insights on the conditions controlling whiting events in lakes, highlighting a tight coupling of their dynamics with processes acting at the catchment scale.

J	Ulusoy, I				Ulusoy, Inan			Temporal radiative heat flux estimation and alteration mapping of Tendurek volcano (eastern Turkey) using ASTER imagery	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												Tendtirek volcano is a polygenetic, basaltic shield volcano formed by successive alkaline basalt flows. It is one of the youngest volcanoes of Turkey; both historical and Holocene activities have been reported for the volcano. Continuous hydrothermal and fumarole activity has been observed on the twin summit craters located 4.5 km apart. ASTER daytime and nighttime satellite imagery acquired between 2001 and 2014 are used to calculate surface temperature, surface temperature anomaly and relative radiative heat flux from the craters to determine a base value for the current thermal emission. Surface temperature and surface temperature anomaly calculations yield a heat flux between 14.4 and 35.5 W/m(2) at the western crater and between 7.72 and 28.3 W/m(2) at the eastern crater. These values are well correlated with other known low-level activity volcanoes. The annual and long term consistency of the thermal pattern is investigated. The location and extent of surficial hydrothermal alteration within and surrounding the Tendfirek craters is identified by band ratioing and indexing using ASTER visible through shortwave infrared bands. Spectral identification of gypsum, hydroxides, sulfates, hydrated sulfates and clay mineralisation indicates pervasive acid-sulfate alteration due to the activity of fumarole vents around Tendfirek craters.

The terminal area was covered by eolian sand before 13,000 C-14 BP. Lacustrine deposits covered the eolian sand after 13,000 C-14 BP, but were succeeded rapidly by eolian or fluvial deposits ca. 11,200-10,000 BP. This fact plus the grain-size distribution and CaCO3 content showed that climate was extremely dry during the last glacial, but wet-dry oscillations characterized the late glacial. A single coalescent lake, over 45 m deep and 2130 km(2), formed between 10,000-6400 C-14 BP in the basin. The lake disintegrated into several shallow carbonate lakes or swamps gradually after 6400 C-14 BP. Eolian sand reached into the most part of the basin during the period. The lake evolution in the area generally reflects the East Asian summer monsoon history forced by Northern hemisphere insolation. Short time-scale lake fluctuations also existed in the area since the last glacial. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd and INQUA.

JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES												We investigate rare seismicity in the neighborhood of the Fentale volcano, main Ethiopian rift that occurred in spring 2015 using data recorded by the Ethiopian Seismic Station Network. Over 1350 earthquakes are located and a seismic swarm is observed to the northeast of Fentale volcano, with the largest earthquake having a magnitude of 4.3 ML. Several VT (volcano-tectonic) and LP (long-period) events are observed in the swarm, indicating that it is induced by magmatic intrusion, consistent with dike-induced deformation in the same area inferred from satellite geodesy. The seismic activity commenced at about 40 km depth and migrated southwestward as it shallowed, towards Fentale volcano, suggesting that the dike feeding system might be influenced by the magma rich Afar Depression further to the northeast rather than the adjacent Fentale volcano. An earlier cluster of seismicity in the same area was recorded by a temporary deployment of seismic stations that ran from November 2001 to January 2003; extensive clusters of less well recorded seismic activity in the region occurred in June 1989, January-February 1981, October-November 2003, and 2004. Such frequent seismicity at the Fentale Volcanic Complex coupled with the adjacent fast-growing Lake Basaka poses an eminent and significant risk to Ethiopia's access to Djibouti port, its most important commercial route. This should be a wakeup call to concerned stakeholders to take precautionary measures by developing risk management and rapid response strategies.																			1464-343X	1879-1956				MAY	2024	213								105236	10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2024.105236	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2024.105236		MAR 2024											WOS:001290531000001

The sediment records from deep water consist mainly of alternating clay, gypsum and carbonate units and, in at least two drill sites, extend back > 200 kyr. Most of the lithostratigraphic units are traceable throughout the basin along seismic reflections that serve as seismic stratigraphic boundaries and suggest that the lithostratigraphy can be used to infer regional palaeoenvironmental changes. A revised seismic stratigraphy was established on the basis of integrated lithological and seismic reflection data from the basin. From ca 200 to ca 85 ka, sediments are dominated by carbonate-clay silt, often interbedded with sandy turbidites, indicating a sediment regime dominated by detrital sedimentation in a relatively humid climate. At ca 85 ka, an exposure horizon consisting of gravels, coarse sand and terrestrial gastropods marks a lake lowstand or partial basin desiccation, indicating dry climate conditions. From ca 85 to ca 48 ka, transgressive carbonate-clay sediments, overlain by deep-water clays, suggest a lake level rise and subsequent stabilization at high stage. From ca 48 ka to present, the lithology is characterized by alternating clay and gypsum units. Gypsum deposition correlates with Heinrich Events (i.e. dry climate), whereas clay units coincide with more humid interstadials.					; Gilli, Adrian/B-5238-2014; Mueller, Andreas/D-6272-2013; Ariztegui, Daniel/AFU-2302-2022; Escobar, Jaime/HSE-4459-2023	Guilderson, Thomas/0000-0001-9371-7059; Mueller, Andreas/0000-0003-3513-5776; Brenner, Mark/0000-0001-9837-012X; Kutterolf, Steffen/0000-0002-0645-3399; Gilli, Adrian/0000-0003-4193-2157; Escobar, Jaime/0000-0001-7775-7130; Hodell, David/0000-0001-8537-1588; Anselmetti, Flavio/0000-0002-8785-3641; Ploetze, Michael/0000-0001-9833-4196; Ariztegui, Daniel/0000-0001-7775-5127													0037-0746	1365-3091				AUG	2010	57	5					1220	1245		10.1111/j.1365-3091.2009.01144.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3091.2009.01144.x													WOS:000279767900004
J	MACK, RN; RUTTER, NW; VALASTRO, S; BRYANT, VM				MACK, RN; RUTTER, NW; VALASTRO, S; BRYANT, VM			LATE QUATERNARY VEGETATION HISTORY AT WAITS LAKE, COLVILLE RIVER VALLEY, WASHINGTON	BOTANICAL GAZETTE												A 10.6 m section of mostly calcareous sediments at Waits Lake, Washington [USA] reveals a multizoned history of vegetation change since recession of Pinedale (P-2) glacial ice from the Colville River Valley. The oldest unit with high percentages of Artemisia, Gramineae and Shepherdia canadensis-type pollen characterizes vegetation in which trees were not major components and the climate was cooler and moister than today. Pollen Zone II (.apprx. 10,000-6700 yr before present [BP]) records a warmer period in which diploxylon pine was prominent. Concomitant with the Mazama ash fall (6700 yr BP), Artemisia became particularly prominent (Pollen Zone II) but by about 5000 yr BP, diploxylon pine was conspicuous. This comparatively short-term vegetation change probably indicates the advance of drought-tolerant Artemisia-dominated steppe northward in the Colville River Valley. The modern climax vegetation in the vicinity of Waits Lake (Pseudotsuga-dominated forest) appears to have emerged around 2300 yr BP, although more detailed documentation of this event is hampered by the low pollen production of Pseudotsuga menziesii. The 14C dates from these calcareous sediments were corrected through the use of the Mazama and Glacier Peak ash layers as time-stratigraphic marker horizons.

In this study, we analysed protistan communities in the hypersaline (up to 365 g l(-1) NaCl) anoxic L'Atalante deep-sea basin located in the eastern Mediterranean Sea. Targeting 18S ribosomal RNA retrieved from the basin's lower halocline (3501 m depth) we detected 279 protistan sequences that grouped into 42 unique phylotypes (99% sequence similarity). Statistical analyses revealed that these phylotypes account only for a proportion of the protists inhabiting this harsh environment with as much as 50% missed by this survey. Most phylotypes were affiliated with ciliates (45%), dinoflagellates (21%), choanoflagelates (10%) and uncultured marine alveolates (6%). Sequences from other taxonomic groups like stramenopiles, Polycystinea, Acantharea and Euglenozoa, all of which are typically found in non-hypersaline deep-sea systems, are either missing or very rare in our cDNA clone library. Although many DHAB sequences fell within previously identified environmental clades, a large number branched relatively deeply. Phylotype richness, community membership and community structure differ significantly from a deep seawater reference community (3499 m depth). Also, the protistan community in the L'Atalante basin is distinctively different from any previously described hypersaline community. In conclusion, we hypothesize that extreme environments may exert a high selection pressure possibly resulting in the evolution of an exceptional and distinctive assemblage of protists. The deep hypersaline anoxic basins in the Mediterranean Sea provide an ideal platform to test for this hypothesis and are promising targets for the discovery of undescribed protists with unknown physiological capabilities.
