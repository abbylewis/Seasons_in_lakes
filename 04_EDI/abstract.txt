This data product supports the manuscript "Seasons and seasonality in lakes: a synthesis amid global change" (Lewis et al. 2026; in review). Data were analyzed to understand how seasonality varies among diverse lakes and variables. Specifically, this data publication includes daily mean water temperature, chlorophyll-a, and dissolved oxygen at multiple depths, ice cover (binary), air temperature and solar radiation. Data availability and collection methods differ among lakes, as described in the Methods.
