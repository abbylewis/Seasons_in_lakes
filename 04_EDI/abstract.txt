This data product supports the manuscript "How should we analyze seasons and seasonality in lakes?" (Lewis et al. 2025; in review). The data published here (Lake Rerewhakaaitu and Midway Pond) were analyzed in combination with previously-published data from six other lakes to understand how seasonality varies among lakes and variables. Specifically, this data publication includes daily mean water temperature (surface and bottom), chlorophyll-a, dissolved oxygen (surface and bottom), air temperature, and solar radiation. Data availability and collection methods differ between lakes, as described in the Methods.
