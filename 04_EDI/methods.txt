We compiled in-lake and meteorological data from six lakes. Data include water temperature, chlorophyll-a, and dissolved oxygen at multiple depths, ice cover (binary), air temperature, and solar radiation. All data are summarized to a daily mean at each lake/depth. Data collection methods are described in detail below. 

Lake Arendsee

Lake Arendsee (52.889 °N, 11.474 °E; Zmax = 49 m; Surface area = 514 ha) is a highly eutrophic lake situated in the Northern German Lowlands. The lake is undergoing a regime shift from dimictic to monomictic with periods of inverse stratification during winter being irregular and typically very short in recent years. The average water residence time is 50-60 years. Since 2012, Lake Arendsee has been equipped with an automatic measurement station at the deepest point of the lake. Meteorological parameters are measured in 10 min intervals with an MeteoMS multisensor and a CMP3 pyranometer (Ecotech, Bonn, Germany). Temperature, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, pH, Turbidity, Chl-a, and Phycocyanin are monitored using an automatic profiler (YSI 6600 V2, YSI, USA) with a frequency of four measurements per day during summer. Due to limitations in the power supply, the frequency is reduced during winter to 1-2 profiles per day. In close proximity to the measurement station, a sensor chain equipped with oxygen optodes at 15 distinct depths is deployed (D-Opto Logger, ZebraTec, New Zealand, until 2023; PME Minidot, Precision Measurement Engineering, USA, since 2023). Measurement intervals were 60 min  until 2023 and 30 min afterwards. Data are published in the Freshwater Research and Environmental Database (Jordan & Hupfer, 2018, 2020, 2025). 

Lake Erken

Lake Erken (59.839 °N, 18.632 °E; Zmax = 21 m; Surface area = 2400 ha) is a mesotrophic temperate lake located in east-central Sweden, approximately 70 km north of Stockholm. It is a dimictic lake that typically experiences ~120–150 days of ice cover per year. The average water retention time is approximately 7 years. Lake Erken is one of the few lakes in Northern Europe that has a long history of monitoring (since the 1940s), including both manual and high-frequency automatic measurements of lake and stream stations. The Erken monitoring programme includes measurements of physical and chemical variables as well as plankton composition (Jakobsson et al., 2025; Pierson et al., 2011). The data is openly available through the SITES Data Portal (https://data.fieldsites.se/portal/), including background information, sensor technology, analytical methods and maps. 

Lake Rerewhakaaitu

Lake Rerewhakaaitu (38.29 °S, 176.5 °E, Zmax = 15.8 m; Surface Area = 580) is a shallow, mesotrophic lake located in the Bay of Plenty Region of Aotearoa New Zealand. Lake Rerewhakaaitu is a volcanically-formed, polymictic lake. A high-frequency profiling buoy was deployed at Lake Rerewhakaaitu in February 2021, which collects water quality profiles from the surface to ~12 m eight times per day. Water temperature, dissolved oxygen, and chlorophyll-a fluorescence are measured using Aqualabo Ponsel Digisens pHEH, OptoD, and Turner Designs C7F-C, respectively. A Lufft WS700 Smart Weather meteorological station was also deployed on the profiling buoy with measurements taken every five minutes.

Midway Pond

Midway Pond (44.931 °N, 70.541 °W; Zmax = 9 m; Surface area = 3.35 ha) is an oligotrophic, dimictic, glacially-formed lake with no inlets or outlets, located in the northern Appalachian Mountains, Maine, USA (Nelson et al., 2021). Since November 2022, in situ sensors have been deployed on a subsurface buoy line located at the deepest point in the lake. Temperature was recorded every 15 minutes at each 1 meter depth increment, from 0.5 m above the benthos to 1-m below the surface (HOBO Tidbit temperature loggers; Onset Computer Corporation, Bourne, MA). Dissolved oxygen was measured every 30 minutes at two locations: 0.5 m above the benthos and 1 m below the surface (MiniDOT dissolved oxygen meter; Precision Measurement Engineering, Vista, CA). Chlorophyll was measured at 30 minute intervals, located 1 m below the surface (Cyclops-7F CHL sensor, Turner Designs, San Jose, CA). Mean daily air temperature was sourced at the nearest National Weather Service station (Rangely airport), located 10 km from Midway Pond.

Mohonk Lake

Mohonk Lake (41.766 °N, 74.158 °W; Zmax = 18.5 m; Surface area = 6.9 ha) is a oligo/mesotrophic glacial lake located in the mid Hudson Valley, NY, USA (Oleksy & Richardson, 2024). Mohonk Lake is dimictic and experiences ~30 days of ice cover per year (Oleksy & Richardson, 2024). From November 2016 to May 2018, high‐frequency (15‐min) temperature data were collected using NexSens T‐Node temperature loggers at 1‐m intervals from the surface to 9 m deep. We matched that data with a high‐frequency (1‐hr) meteorology station <5 km from Mohonk Lake (Brotzge et al., 2020). that were linearly interpolated to 15‐min intervals to match the lake thermal data. Meteorological and in-lake data collection methods are described in the published data product (Mohonk Preserve et al., 2020).
